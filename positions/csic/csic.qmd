**Position**: Postdoc  
**Deadline**: 8 March 2023 

## Job description

Do you have a background in the social sciences and an interest in the topic of (ethnic) discrimination? Are you enthusiastic about the opportunity to be part of an international team and develop research based on cutting-edge experimental methods? If so, consider applying for an exciting postdoctoral research opportunity at CSIC, the National Research Council in Spain.  

As a member of the coordinating team of the EQUALSTRENGTH consortium, you will work closely with Dr. Héctor Cebolla Boado, the local project coordinator and Senior Scientist at CSIC. The role requires experienced quantitative social scientists with a relevant doctorate (or close to completion) in a social sciences discipline and theoretical expertise on ethnic discrimination and immigrant integration.   

In this position, you will work on the development of the research design in collaboration with other consortium members and coordinate the data collection of different field experiments (audit studies). You will also be involved in organizing consortium meetings and undertake project management tasks in collaboration with the local project coordinator.  

**The EQUALSTRENGTH Consortium**

EQUALSTRENGTH is a consortium of ten international partners (University College Dublin,  University of Oxford, University of Utrecht, University of Amsterdam, The German Center for  Integration and Migration Research, Vrije Universiteit Brussel, The Budapest Institute, Charles  University, Spanish National Research Council and University of Lausanne), funded through  the Horizon Europe Framework Programme under the topic call “Strengthening racial, ethnic  and religious equality”. The consortium brings together scholars from a broad range of social  sciences, including social psychology, sociology, demography, economics, social policy.    


The EQUALSTRENGTH consortium aims to investigate the reasons behind and extent to  which ethnic, racial, and religious minorities are subjected to discriminatory behaviors and  prejudicial attitudes across various life domains, such as employment, housing, and access to  services. Furthermore, the project examines how this continued exposure to and prejudice accumulates at the intersection of stigmatized identities over the course of one's  life.   

The structural and cumulative pattern of disadvantage experienced by minorities is a  significant concern for societies committed to promoting inclusivity and equal opportunities for  all. The EQUALSTRENGTH consortium aims to investigate the cumulative and structural  forms of discrimination, perceived discrimination, outgroup prejudice, and hate crimes from an  intersectional and cross-setting perspective.By taking an intersectional approach, the project  aims to understand how different forms of discrimination intersect and contribute to the  accumulation of disadvantage over time. The main contribution of EQUALSTRENGTH is to  provide new insights into the experiences of minorities and inform policies and interventions  that promote equality and social inclusion.
