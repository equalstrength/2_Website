Do you have a background in quantitative methods and an interest in the topic of ethnic discrimination? Are you enthusiastic about the opportunity to be part of an international team and develop research based on cutting-edge experimental methods?  

The Institute for Social and Political Sciences jointly with the Graduate School for Public Administration of the University of Lausanne are looking for a Postdoctoral researcher (80%), April 1st, 2023. The postdoctoral researcher will become a member in the EQUALSTRENGTH consortium and will work in close collaboration with Prof. Stephanie Steinmetz and Ass. Prof. Flavia Fossati.


## Introduction

UNIL is a leading international teaching and research institution, with over 5,000 employees and 15,500 students split between its Dorigny campus, CHUV and Epalinges. As an employer, UNIL encourages excellence, individual recognition, and responsibility. The University of Lausanne is an Equal Opportunities Employer. Qualified women and candidates with a migration history are encouraged to apply. 
 

## Information regarding the project

EQUALSTRENGTH is a Horizon Europe funded project bringing together ten leading international partners (Utrecht University, University College Dublin, University of Oxford, University of Amsterdam, The German Center for Integration and Migration Research, Vrije Universiteit Brussel, The Budapest Institute, Charles University, The Spanish National Research Council and University of Lausanne) on a broad range of social sciences (e.g., social psychology, sociology, demography, economics, social policy).  

The project will investigate cross-nationally and from an intersectional perspective, why and to what extent ethnic, racial, and religious minorities are exposed to discriminatory behaviour and prejudicial attitudes in multiple life domains since birth. It studies how this continuous exposure accumulates over the life course and perpetuates minoritiesâ€™ subordinate position over generations. For societies that strive to be inclusive and guarantee equal opportunities for all their members, this structural and cumulative pattern of disadvantage is a major concern.
