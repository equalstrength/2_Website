    "text": "Ethnic, racial and religious minorities experience discriminatory behaviour and prejudicial attitudes in multiple life domains, which accumulates across the life course. This continuous exposure perpetuates minorities’ subordinate position across generations. The main contribution of EqualStrength is to investigate cumulative and structural forms of discrimination, outgroup prejudice and hate crimes against ethnic, racial and religious minorities from a cross-setting and intersectional perspective. We deploy innovative, targetted and effective methods, which include field experiments, population-level secondary survey data, meso-level policy analysis and targeted data collection to include the perspective of minority groups who directly confront discrimination."

Are you enthusiastic about the opportunity to be part of an international team and develop research based on cutting-edge experimental methods? If so, consider applying for an exciting postdoctoral research opportunity at CSIC, the National Research Council in Spain.\nAs a member of the coordinating team of the EQUALSTRENGTH consortium, you will work closely with Dr. Héctor Cebolla Boado, the local project coordinator and Senior Scientist at CSIC. The role requires experienced quantitative social scientists with a relevant doctorate (or close to completion) in a social sciences discipline and theoretical expertise on ethnic discrimination and immigrant integration.\nIn this position, you will work on the development of the research design in collaboration with other consortium members and coordinate the data collection of different field experiments (audit studies). You will also be involved in organizing consortium meetings and undertake project management tasks in collaboration with the local project coordinator.\nThe EQUALSTRENGTH Consortium\nEQUALSTRENGTH is a consortium of ten international partners (University College Dublin, University of Oxford, University of Utrecht, University of Amsterdam, The German Center for Integration and Migration Research, Vrije Universiteit Brussel, The Budapest Institute, Charles University, Spanish National Research Council and University of Lausanne), funded through the Horizon Europe Framework Programme under the topic call “Strengthening racial, ethnic and religious equality”. The consortium brings together scholars from a broad range of social sciences, including social psychology, sociology, demography, economics, social policy.\nThe EQUALSTRENGTH consortium aims to investigate the reasons behind and extent to which ethnic, racial, and religious minorities are subjected to discriminatory behaviors and prejudicial attitudes across various life domains, such as employment, housing, and access to services. Furthermore, the project examines how this continued exposure to and prejudice accumulates at the intersection of stigmatized identities over the course of one’s life.\nThe structural and cumulative pattern of disadvantage experienced by minorities is a significant concern for societies committed to promoting inclusivity and equal opportunities for all. The EQUALSTRENGTH consortium aims to investigate the cumulative and structural forms of discrimination, perceived discrimination, outgroup prejudice, and hate crimes from an intersectional and cross-setting perspective.By taking an intersectional approach, the project aims to understand how different forms of discrimination intersect and contribute to the accumulation of disadvantage over time. The main contribution of EQUALSTRENGTH is to provide new insights into the experiences of minorities and inform policies and interventions that promote equality and social inclusion."

The DeZIM Institute receives funding from the German Federal Ministry for Family Affairs, Senior Citizens, Women and Youth (BMFSFJ) and seeks to combine excellent academic research with evidence-based policy advice.\nThe advertised third-party funding position is based at the DeZIM Institute in the DeZIM.lab of the Cluster Data-Methods- Monitoring. The DeZIM.lab focuses on experimental methods for researching questions in the field of migration and integration. The work in the project is supported by a student assistant and takes place in close cooperation with Dr Susanne Veit.\nEQUALSTRENGTH is an international project funded by the Horizon Europe Programme of the European Commission. The project is carried out in cooperation with ten international partners (Utrecht University, University College Dublin, Oxford University, University of Amsterdam, DeZIM Institute, Vrije Universiteit Brussels, The Budapest Institute, Charles University, Spanish National Research Council and University of Lausanne). It brings together researchers from different (social) science disciplines (especially social psychology, sociology, demography, economics, social policy).\nThe aim of the EQUALSTRENGTH project is to investigate why and to what extent ethnic and religious minorities are exposed to discriminatory behavior and prejudiced attitudes in different areas of life (e.g., employment, housing, childcare). In addition, the project will examine whether and how this ongoing exposure to prejudice and discrimination accumulates at the intersection of stigmatized identities and across different domains of life.\nThe researcher will be involved in various empirical quantitative work packages of the EQUALSTRENGTH project, in particular the implementation of field experiments on discrimination in Germany (employment, housing and childcare), the implementation and coordination of a survey experiment (cognitive test: Avoidance Task) on a DeZIM proprietary platform (MIND.set), the implementation of population questions, and the research of relevant statistical indicators for Germany."
