:::{#person-profile}
I am Associate Professor at the Department of Interdisciplinary Social Science of Utrecht University, where I am affiliated to ERCOMER, the European Research Centre on Migration and Ethnic Relations. I am also a Visiting Fellow of the European University Institute (EUI) in Florence. My research focuses on ethnic and religious discrimination at the workplace, combining perspectives from sociology, social psychology, socio-legal and organizational studies. Currently, I am also the Principal Investigator of the project TARGETS (ERC Starting Grant, 2022-2027), a cross-national, interdisciplinary and multi-method analysis of discrimination attributions and coping strategies. Before joining Utrecht University, I was a Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of Oxford and at the WZB Berlin Social Science Centre. In 2014, I obtained my doctoral degree from the University of Amsterdam. My research has been published in peer-review journals such as: Annual Review of Sociology, British Journal of Sociology, Sociology, Social Forces, European Sociological Review, Journal of Ethnic and Migration Studies, Research in Social Stratification and Mobility, Social Psychology Quarterly.
