:::{#person-profile}

I am a social scientist specialised in educational and social indicators. My research spreads across distinct fields such as comparative sociology, public policy, and social research methods.

Before joining the UCD [Geary Institute for Public Policy](www.ucd.ie/geary), I  worked in the administration of the [European Social Survey](www.europeansocialsurvey.org) in Ireland and served as the coordinator for international statistics at the National Institute for Educational Research and Studies ([INEP](www.inep.gov.br)) in Brazil. I have also held research positions at the University of Bristol, University of Oxford, and University of Brasilia.
