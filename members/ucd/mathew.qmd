:::{#person-profile}

I graduated from the University of Pennsylvania in 2009 with a joint PhD in sociology and demography.  Before arriving at the [School of Sociology at University College Dublin](https://people.ucd.ie/mathew.creighton) in 2016, I worked as a postdoctoral researcher in the [Office of Population Research](https://pop.princeton.edu) at Princeton University, a lecturer in the Department of Political and Social Science at the [Universitat Pompeu Fabra](https://www.upf.edu/web/demosoc/) and an assistant professor in the Sociology Department at the [University of Massachusetts, Boston](https://www.umb.edu/academics/cla/sociology). 


I am an unapologetic, serial collaborator who is dedicated to interdisciplinary perspectives.  Reflective of my rejection of any bright lines between disciplines in social science is a pursuit of peer-reviewed publication in sociology, demography, political science, criminology, public health, history and urban studies.  My complete CV can be found [here](https://sites.google.com/site/mathewjcreighton/cv).
