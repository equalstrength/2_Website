1 Excellence
Ethnic, racial and religious minorities experience discriminatory behaviour and prejudicial attitudes in multiple life domains, which accumulates across the life course This continuous exposure perpetuates minorities’ subordinate position across generations For societies that strive to be inclusive and guarantee equal opportunities for all their members, this structural and cumulative pattern of disadvantage is a major concern The unequal treatment of people or groups based on their ethnicity, race and/or religion is not only problematic from a normative perspective; it also has a negative impact on economic growth, social cohesion, and public health From the perspective of victims, discrimination and prejudice  whether blatant or subtle, conscious or unconscious  are damaging for their wellbeing Moreover, the recent Black Lives Matter Movement that illuminated the pervasive impact of institutional racism, offer a powerful reminder that ethnic and religious inequalities are not only harmful, but also deeply rooted in contemporary societies
The main contribution of EqualStrength is to investigate cumulative and structural forms of discrimination, outgroup prejudice and hate crimes against ethnic, racial and religious minorities from a cross setting and intersectional perspective In doing so, we not only focus on direct and indirect forms of discrimination against minority groups in different life domains, but also on minorities’ coping strategies when facing subtler forms of bias and unequal treatment in daily interactions, also known as microaggressions Importantly, we put the family at the forefront of our analysis, improving on previous studies that have focused on discrimination against an individual person in a single instance, without taking the broader context into consideration We focus on the gendered, racialized and socio economic elements of outgroup hostility and analyse how they cumulate and intersect across key life domains Moreover, we study whether and how the structural disadvantage and systemic discrimination that minority families experience in their lives vary according to local policies, and institutional and political contexts
11 Objectives and ambition
EqualStrength takes as a point of departure that ethnic, racial and religious inequalities are reciprocally related across multiple settings, mutually reinforcing, and exacerbating over time (Blank, 2005) The interwoven character of differential treatment by ethnicity, race or religion has been coined by Reskin (2012, p 19) as “über (or meta) discrimination” Previous research, however, has mainly examined direct discrimination1 in a single setting at a specific moment in time and often from an individual (and typically male) perspective Already twenty five years ago, Bonilla Silva’s (1997) seminal ‘Rethinking racism’ asserted that racism is systemic and structural Yet, mainstream approaches in sociology, economics and social psychology still predominantly equate racism to hostile attitudes or beliefs operating at the individual level (Sidanius & Pratto, 1999), largely neglecting the racialized structures that maintain and reproduce power imbalances between groups While recent contributions emphasised
1 Direct discrimination is defined as a situation “where one person is treated less favourably than another [] in a comparable situation on grounds of racial or ethnic origin”; indirect discrimination as “a situation in which an apparently neutral provision, criterion or practice would put persons of a racial or ethnic origin at a particular disadvantage compared with other persons, unless that provision, criterion or practice is objectively justified by a legitimate aim and the means of achieving that aim are appropriate and necessary” (Article 22, Council Directive 2000/43/EC of 29 June 2000)
 PART B   2


subtler forms of prejudice, such as symbolic and modern racism, (eg Dovidio et al, 2017; Esses, 2021), research that takes a multi domain perspective to explain outgroup hostility is scant As a result, structural racism as experienced by victims is underestimated, and our understanding of its institutionalised patterning across life domains remains limited
EqualStrength adopts a cross setting perspective on cumulative disadvantage to study structural and institutional discrimination and outgroup hostility across key life domains, including employment, housing, access to public services such as childcare, and leisure settings In parallel, we study how people understand and cope with episodes of discrimination and microaggressions in their everyday lives Our approach builds on scholarly work that studies perceptions of discrimination (Barreto & Ellemers, 2015), but overlooked the psychological consequences of continuous exposure to systemic discrimination and microaggressions Understanding the victims’ experiences of discrimination based on race, ethnicity or religion across life domains is also crucial from an intersectional perspective, as episodes of unequal treatment take very different forms depending on people’s gender, sexual orientation, or social background (Harnois & Ifatunji, 2011; Pedulla, 2014, 2018)
Concretely, we seek to address five interrelated research objectives:
1 To capture structural forms of ethnic and racial discrimination in the domains of employment, housing and
access to childcare We focus on the most stigmatised ethnic minorities in the European context: Muslims,
Roma and black immigrants from sub Saharan Africa
2 To examine the systemic nature of prejudice and hate crime across life domains (with a particular focus on
anti migrant, anti Muslim, anti Black and anti Roma attitudes)
3 To analyse the role of policy and institutional factors in minority groups’ exposure to structural
discrimination, prejudice and hate crime, which allows evidence based policy recommendations to mitigate
discrimination in childcare, housing and employment
4 To document the lived experiences of minority groups (with a particular focus on Muslim, Roma and black
minorities) and the coping strategies they adopt to deal with everyday discrimination and microaggressions
5 To analyse the experiences and consequences of discrimination and prejudice from an intersectional perspective, focusing on how race, ethnicity and religion intersect with gender and socioeconomic position
to produce unequal outcomes
The conceptual framework of EqualStrength focuses on ethnic minorities and examines their exposure to
systematic discrimination and structural racism across multiple settings We look especially at highly marginalised groups: Muslim, black and Roma minorities In differentiating between settings, we study access to childcare services, employment opportunities and housing as three interrelated life domains Because discrimination and hostility in one domain may, directly or indirectly, change outcomes and opportunities in other domains, a multi domain approach can reveal a pattern of cumulative disadvantage and social exclusion over time and across generations, explained in greater detail below Four work packages (WP2   WP5) address the structural inequalities that characterise the working, learning and living conditions of minority families by analysing gatekeepers (eg employers, landlords and real estate agents, childcare administrators), the society at large, and the perceptions of vulnerable minority groups across different institutional contexts The conceptual approach of the project is visualised in figure 1
Figure 1 The conceptual approach of EqualStrength
 PART B   3


111 Family perspective
The first key contribution is the shift of focus from individuals at risk to vulnerable minority families To fully grasp the accumulated and structural nature of outgroup prejudice and discrimination, EqualStrength adopts a gendered family perspective This is necessary to analyse how discrimination and racism are both experienced by men and women individually as well as accumulating and intersecting at the family level The structural and systemic nature of discrimination means that its impact is also transmitted across generations, affecting family dynamics and relations (Gaston, 2021; Bryant Davis et al, 2017) Furthermore, one of the main insights of life course research is that key domains of life, such as work and access to services (eg childcare), are not only interrelated, but also nested within families (Kohli, 2007) Previous studies on racism and discrimination, however, have primarily, if not exclusively, focused on the disadvantage and unequal treatment experienced by single individuals While scholars acknowledge that access to economic, social and cultural resources is heavily shaped by family background and varies by gender (Heath, Rothon & Kilpi, 2008), the outcomes under study are often centred on the individual Our focus on families recognizes that minority families face barriers in multiple domains of life: for example, hostility directed towards a family member could have spillover effects on intra family dynamics in terms of relationship quality and exposure to stressors (Gaston, 2021; Thoits, 2010)
In addition, we analyse how interlinked patterns of discrimination, prejudice and hate crimes vary according to institutional and policy factors at both local and national levels We underline the importance of family policies, as they play a crucial role in countering the heavily gendered integration policies that have historically placed migrant families on the edge of societal participation (Pincus, 1996) More recent research on the role of parental leave and child support policies in reducing gender gaps in employment focuses exclusively on majority populations (Cooke, 2010; Notten et al, 2017) It is, however, crucial to acknowledge the importance of the family situation and exposure to ethnic discrimination in domains that affect labour market activation, eg access to childcare services and housing For example, ethnic discrimination in access to childcare facilities can heavily constrain parents’ options to combine family obligations and dual earner employment, most often relegating women to the role of stay at home mothers To the extent that employers are less willing to grant part time and other family friendly arrangements to members of ethnic minorities, discrimination in one setting (ie access to childcare) can compound discrimination in another setting (ie the labour market)
112 Cumulation of risks and disadvantages
The second key contribution of EqualStrength is the theoretical and empirical shift from setting specific discrimination against single subordinate groups to cumulative, structural and intersectional disadvantage, which occurs simultaneously in different life domains, across the life course, and at the intersection of group identities This is important for three reasons First, even relatively small effects in one domain can cumulate to large effects over time, precisely because exposure to racism and discrimination at one decision point and in one area might increase the risk of future discrimination at another decision point in a different area (Blank, 2005; Hardy III et al, 2020) For example, the discrimination literature has almost exclusively focused on single settings, most notably the labour market (Zschirnt & Ruedin, 2016) Similarly, a structural perspective on negativity towards outgroups, taking the target as a focal point, although acknowledged, is seldom empirically examined Yet, taking the concept of structural racism at heart means acknowledging that lawful and seemingly uncontroversial policies and practices can exacerbate inequalities between groups even in the absence of direct discrimination (whether intentional or not) and hostility
Second, exposure to hostility and discrimination in one life domain affects the behaviour and victims’ perceptions in other domains, or over time For example, social psychologists have shown that people who have experienced past episodes of discrimination are more likely to display a vigilance bias and interpret events as discriminatory in the future (Barreto & Ellemers, 2015) People can also interpret their experiences of discrimination as motivated by different factors, such as their ethnicity or religious affiliation These contributions point to the need for research that takes a multi domain perspective, which addresses the accumulation of disadvantage across life domains However, such a link is currently lacking EqualStrength applies a systemic perspective to the analysis of attitudes (prejudice/racism), perceptions and coping strategies (lived experiences), behaviour (discrimination) and policies
Third, from an intersectional perspective (Crenshaw, 1989; Purdie Vaughns & Eibach, 2008), various types of social group memberships interact with one another and produce complex patterns of advantage and disadvantage, resulting in a cumulation of discrimination across intersecting statuses An intersectional perspective is enriching for research on outgroup prejudice which, so far, has paid little attention to interconnected social identities, assuming instead that the psychology of prejudice is the same across subcategories of targets Finally, our focus on multiple settings allows us to examine the domains within which prototypical as well as non prototypical group members are likely to experience discrimination and hostility As such, EqualStrength offers theoretical refinement to
PART B   4


intersectionality theory, which has long debated whether minority women suffer double (or triple) burdens for their multiple stigmatised identities, or, in contrast, may benefit from their intersectional invisibility (Navarrete et al, 2010; Purdie Vaughn & Eibach, 2008) Having multiple stigmatised statuses may exacerbate the risk of experiencing discrimination or even attenuate it, as shown by Pedulla (2014) for the intersection of race and sexual orientation and by Bonnet et al (2016) for the intersection of ethnicity and socioeconomic status EqualStrength examines the extent to which disadvantage is additive, multiplicative or characterised by a more complex and nuanced type of intersectionality
113 Multi actor approach: gatekeepers, policies, society at large, vulnerable groups
The third key contribution of our project is the multi actor and multi level perspective, an integrated approach simultaneously considering multiple actors (ie gatekeepers; ethnic, racial and religious minorities; majority groups) and levels of analysis (ie the micro level of individual decisions; the meso level of organisations, neighbourhoods, rental agencies and childcare facilities; the macro level of countries and nation wide institutions) An integrated approach allows us to study the contextual conditions that exacerbate or mitigate patterns of cumulative disadvantage This knowledge is necessary to devise effective policy interventions Specifically, WP2 examines the behaviour of gatekeepers (ie, employers, real estate agents, landlords, and preschool administrators  in preventing access to employment, housing and childcare services, respectively WP3 analyses policy and institutional contexts at both the national, the municipality and the neighbourhood level A multilevel perspective on cumulative discrimination can identify effective policies across domains; it can also reveal whether policies that are seemingly neutral in one domain have unintended effects in another domain WP4 shifts the attention to the society at large and examines prejudicial attitudes towards specific outgroups Finally, WP5 zooms in on the lived experiences of vulnerable minority groups and their coping strategies when dealing with systemic discrimination and structural racism WP5 also examines support for different types of policies aimed at reducing discrimination among minority populations
12 Description of EqualStrength specific objectives
121 Measuring cumulative discrimination across life domains (WP2)
One of the main objectives of EqualStrength is to conceptualize and empirically measure cumulative discrimination across settings To achieve this, we address five limitations of previous research on discrimination First, correspondence studies have conceptualized and measured ethnic discrimination in a single setting at a specific moment in time  eg, being denied a job interview (Di Stasio et al, 2021;
Veit & Thijssen, 2021), an apartment viewing (Auspurg et al, 2019;
Verhaeghe & De Coninck, 2022), or a service (Bourabain et al, 2020;
Olsen et al, 2020) because of one’s ethnic, racial or religious background
Unfortunately, this approach does not include the interwoven and
accumulated character of ‘meta discrimination’ (Reskin, 2012, p 19), in
which discrimination is reciprocally related across multiple settings,
mutually reinforcing and accumulating over time (Blank, 2005)
EqualStrength addresses this shortcoming by conceptualizing and
measuring the institutionalized patterning of discrimination across three
life domains: access to housing, employment and childcare These three
life domains are profoundly interlinked Without a proper job, finding a decent house or vacant childcare spot can be very challenging In turn, living in a disadvantaged neighbourhood can restrict people’s employment opportunities, in terms of a lack of spatial proximity to jobs and pervasive address based discrimination (eg, Bunel et al, 2016) Without childcare, it is more difficult to look for a job or to work full time, particularly for women To the best of our knowledge, discrimination in the access to childcare has rarely been studied, though research indicates that public administrators discriminate against minorities in nurseries and primary schools (Bourabain et al, 2020; Olsen et al, 2020)
A second limitation in previous research is the use of an individual perspective when considering victims of discrimination Existing studies typically examine discrimination against individual candidates, but neglect that individuals are often embedded in families As explained above, a family approach provides a more complete understanding of the interlinked nature of meta discrimination As the first study of its kind, WP2 examines discrimination in housing, hiring and childcare with a particular attention to the cumulation of disadvantage within families For example, by considering access to childcare services as a pre condition for (women’s) entry into employment, the family level perspective reveals how one domain of disadvantage (ie, childcare) can spill over into another (ie, work)
Third, although correspondence tests have been widely used during the past decades, there are still many minority groups and contexts which have yet to be examined (Verhaeghe, 2022) While opinion surveys suggest that
 PART B   5


discrimination against the Roma is widespread in most countries with a sizeable Roma minority (European Commission 2019), systematic evidence on the incidence of discrimination in the labour market or other domains is scarce The only field experiment on the labour market focusing on Roma to date is Bartoš et al (2016), who report an 18 percentage point lower call back rate for Roma applicants compared to white majority applicants in the Czech Republic There is also some evidence from field experiments that Roma face discrimination in accessing services: in the private rental market (Bartoš et al, 2016), government services (Mikula & Montag, 2022), and childcare or other municipal services (Simonovits et al, 2021) EqualStrength compares groups that are highly stigmatised in the nine European countries of the consortium Previous studies found discrimination is most severe for ethnic, racial and religious groups who are more culturally distant from the majority population (Koopmans et al, 2019) or originating from less socio economically developed regions (Thijssen et al, 2021) Muslims, in particular, are among the most stigmatized groups in Europe, where Islam functions as a bright symbolic boundary (Creighton et al, 2022; Fleischmann, 2022) Muslims are also more often treated with suspicion in everyday encounters and less likely to receive help from strangers (Bourabain & Verhaeghe, 2019) Additionally, though references to race are rare in the European context, research consistently finds ethnic discrimination is most severe for black minorities, especially groups originating from Sub Saharan Africa, in both private settings and the public space (Fibbi et al, 2021; Thissen et al, 2021) In addition to anti Roma discrimination, we study anti Muslim and anti black discrimination
Fourth, there is a remarkable lack of field experimental studies in East  and Central Europe (Verhaeghe 2022) For example, recent meta analyses only mention two Czech studies about labour market discrimination (Lippens et al 2021; Quillian & Midtbøen 2021) and two studies  one Czech and one Slovakian  about rental discrimination (Flage 2018) This causes a fundamental West  and South European bias in the knowledge about discrimination in Europe Furthermore, with only a few notable exceptions (see, for example, the GEMM study: Lancee, 2021), most studies on ethnic discrimination study one country at a time Although there is some evidence that hiring discrimination varies substantially across countries (Quillian et al, 2019), comparative evidence of variation in other forms of discrimination across different national institutional settings is largely absent This is a non trivial gap in our understandingThe levels and patterns of discrimination might be substantially different depending on the national context Understanding these differences allows scholars to understand the role of contextual factors in perpetuating ethnic disctrimination Therefore, WP2 examines ethnic meta discrimination in nine countries, including two East  European (Czech Republic and Hungary)
Finally, our knowledge of trends across time in ethnic discrimination remains limited While recent meta  analyses have documented a steady decline in ethnic discrimination in housing and lending markets (Auspurg et al, 2019; Quillian et al, 2020), others have found no signs of progress in the domain of employment (Heath & Di Stasio, 2019; Quillian et al, 2017; Zschirnt & Ruedin, 2016) On the one hand, this is surprising given the strong commitment to organizational diversity and legislative efforts, at the national and European level, to prevent workplace discrimination On the other hand, no firm conclusions can be drawn from meta analysis that can only superficially control for differences in experimental protocols and designs across studies and national contexts EqualStrength offers a clear pathway forward
122 Examining the policy and institutional contexts of discrimination and prejudice (WP3)
Previous research on discrimination has focused on empirical links between results from correspondence tests and various theoretical mechanisms that could explain observed variation in discriminatory behaviour (Gaddis 2019) One strand in the literature focuses on the extent to which economic mechanisms drive patterns of discrimination, such as taste based discrimination (Becker 1971) and statistical discrimination (Arrow 1971) Another strand focusses on social psychological constructs to explain discrimination, such as explicit or implicit attitudes or threat perceptions (Ziegert & Hanges 2005) EqualStrength examines a third and often overlooked strand in the literature that, asks a key question: To what extent can contextual factors explain varying levels of ethnic
discrimination? Whereas the economic and social psychological theories draw conclusions from the perspective of individual actors (eg what are ethnic ‘distastes’ or attitudes of employers or landlords and which information do they use), recent work has sought to bring forward theoretical perspective that accounts for contextual factors and institutions (Lancee 2021; Reskin 2003; Tomaskovic Devey & Avent Holt 2017) The ‘new institutionalist’ theory emphasises that the behaviour of social actors is shaped by national and local contexts (Brinton & Nee 1998) Thus, to understand discriminatory behaviour, the context in which decisions are made is crucial
This insight is not new: for example, an extensive literature documents the organisational determinants of workplace inequality (Baron & Bielby, 1980; Tomaskovic Devey & Avent Holt, 2017) Likewise, the sociological
 PART B   6


literature on institutional discrimination has drawn attention to the structural component of discrimination and the reproduction of stark inequalities even in the absence of intentionally discriminatory behaviour (Bonilla Silva, 1997; Golash Boza, 2016; Reskin, 2012; Small & r, 2020) Though from different theoretical angles, all these contributions point to the need for research that links discriminatory outcomes to the context of employment Because most correspondence studies are carried out within a specific context  one city, region or country  most scholars lack the data to investigate these institutionalist or structuralist explanations, which require the simultaneous implementation of fieldwork in multiple contexts Furthermore, national policy in one domain could have spill over effects across other life domains because of the intersectional and cumulative effects of discrimination (Blank, 2005) It is therefore crucial to include multiple measures of discrimination, across different domains, when comparing policy contexts and their impact on discrimination
An institutionalist approach reflects a growing awareness that racism and discrimination should be tackled from a multi level perspective This so called ‘local turn’ in integration studies has drawn attention to the importance of addressing the challenges of migrant incorporation at the local level (Zapata Barrero et al 2017) Municipalities differ in why and how they govern migrant incorporation and their relationships with other public, private and social actors (horizontal dimension) and higher governmental levels (vertical dimension) Therefore, WP3 examines how levels of “meta discrimination” are shaped by institutional and policy factors at both the local and national level We focus on the interrelated and cumulative forms of discrimination that we identify in WP2 (child care, housing and hiring), which we study in the nine countries involved in the EqualStrenght project As such WP3 contributes to the field in how discrimination levels differ according to (1) existing policies and legislation of anti discrimination, inclusiveness and multiculturalism and (2) national welfare state regimes and their gendered family policies A better understanding of these contextual policy and institutional factors also facilitates evidence based policy recommendations to tackle discrimination in child care, housing, and hiring
123 Capturing outgroup prejudices across life domains (WP4)
EqualStrength studies the majority’s prejudicial attitudes against ethnic, racial and religious outgroups across key domains of life with a combination of secondary and primary data sources Individuals tend to evaluate their own group favourably compared to outgroups (ingroup bias) or even treat outgroups outright unfavourably or hostile (Aboud, 2003; Riek et al, 2006) Indeed, a plethora of research has documented persistently negative attitudes towards minorities, most notably towards individuals of ethnic, racial and religious minorities (Creighton and Jamal, 2015) or refugees (Hager & Veit, 2019; Bansak et al, 2016), and this finding is robust across countries and over time (Ceobanu and Escandell 2010; Storm et al 2017)
However, research on outgroup prejudice is hampered by the same conceptual limitations as many discrimination studies Previous research has extensively studied prejudices in general (Gallego & Pardos Prado, 2014; Ceobanu & Escandell, 2010) or in specific life domains, such as the workplace (Pecoraro & Ruedin, 2016), neighbourhoods (Maxwell, 2019; van Heerden & Ruedin, 2019), healthcare (Pinillos Franco & Kawachi, 2021), or intermarriage (Rodríguez García et al, 2016; Tolsma et al, 2008) Yet, prejudice in these domains is rarely combined and a structural perspective on negativity towards outgroups, although acknowledged, is seldomly empirically examined
This lack of empirical research is surprising, as several theoretical approaches emphasise that, to understand and ultimately reduce outgroup derogation, a holistic and interrelated perspective is needed
ewise, a fundamental principle in life course theory is that changes in human life evolve over a
007) Therefore,
EqualStrength focuses on outgroup prejudice from a family perspective and how it is interlinked across life domains By doing so, we take the target of prejudice as a point of departure, and study how hostility manifests itself differently in key domains of life Furthermore, following structural racism and intersectionality theories, we study potential spillover effects of outgroup hostility from one life domain (eg, the workplace) into other domains (eg housing, childcare) A key consideration is the different manifestations of outgroup hostility towards targets with intersecting social group memberships (eg ethnic minority status and sexual orientation), in particular those with non  prototypical statuses (eg homosexual Muslim men)
In addition, research that empirically links outgroup attitudes to discriminatory behaviour is scant (Esses 2021,
  of intersectionality posits that the multidimensionality of the discrimination experience cannot be captured by looking
For example, the theory
  only at gender or race as singular grounds for discrimination, (Crenshaw, 1989) Similarly, theories of structural racism emphasise the interaction of multiple institutions in an ongoing process sustaining racialized outcomes (Powell
  2007) Lik
lifetime
 and, as such, are the result of an interrelated series of events occurring in multiple domains (Kohli 2
PART B   7


) There are only few studies that combine behavioural
124 Perceptions of racism and discrimination: minorities’ policy preferences and coping strategies across domains (WP 5)
EqualStrength places minorities’ lived experiences, perceptions, and preferences at the forefront of the analysis In doing so, the project will increase scholarly knowledge about (1) the extent to which minority individuals perceive themselves or their group as targets of discriminatory behaviours and micro  and macroaggressions in relevant social domains, and the consequences of those perceptions on their wellbeing; (2) minorities’ preferred coping strategies to discriminatory situations
in different social settings; (3) minorities’ policy preferences to reduce ethnic and racial inequalities that are the product of cumulative discrimination; and (4) the impact of the Covid 19 pandemic on perceptions of discrimination To study these three aspects, the project relies on both secondary and primary data sources
As pointed out by Small and r (2020), the study of minorities’ perceived discrimination is not a ‘poor analytical substitute’ for that of perpetrated discrimination  as measured, for example, in field experiments  but it should be a complement to it Studying perceptions and experiences of discrimination and micro/macroaggressions is therefore crucial, as these experiences impact minorities’ behaviour as well as their physical and mental health (Nadal et al, 2014) Research shows that the perception of being discriminated against and, importantly, the reasons for it differ between ethnic, racial and religious groups (Auer & Ruedin 2019) Contemporary forms of discrimination and racism are generally more covert than in the past, which means that individuals differ in the extent to which they recognise them as such and/or can identify the reason for them (Quillian 2006) Moreover, the extent to which people feel discriminated against varies according to individual characteristics (Auer & Ruedin, 2019), contextual factors (McGinnity & Gijsberts, 2016) and across societal domains where discrimination may occur (Maxwell, 2015) For example, highly educated migrants report more societal discrimination in surveys than migrants of the same ethnicity with lower levels of education, a phenomenon known as the ‘integration paradox’ (Schaeffer, 2019; Steinmann, 2018)
EqualStrength investigates minorities’ perceptions of discrimination levels in multiple life domains, including the labour and housing markets, and health care, among others In doing so, we examine whether perceptions vary across ethnic, religious, racial and gender lines, as well as across countries, and the reasons for those variations In addition, we examine how these perceptions impact minorities’ subjective wellbeing (Lewis et al, 2015), and whether those impacts are similar across minorities in different national contexts We rely on cross  national and national survey data such as, eg, the Second EU Minorities and Discrimination Survey, to measure minorities’ perceptions The linked field experimental data on discrimination across settings tell us how perceptions relate to ‘objective’ measures of cumulative discrimination Likewise, we investigate the role of national and local institutional contexts in those perceptions, in order to examine whether discriminatory behaviours and racism are more likely to be recognized as such in areas with historically strong anti discrimination policies (Ziller, 2014)
EqualStrength also investigates variations across minorities in attributions, ie their interpretations of a range of situations as discriminatory or micro aggressions, particularly when they are subtle and ambiguous; and in their coping strategies or reactions to those situations (Lamont and Mizrachi, 2011) We examine these aspects with a vignette study (or factorial survey), where minorities are asked to evaluate the degree to which they consider a range of situations involving members of the majority and minority groups as unfair or discriminatory; the reason for that evaluation; and the extent to which they self identify with the reaction of the minority character(s) depicted in the vignette
EqualStrength pays attention to variations across minorities in their support for race or ethnic targeted policies aimed at reducing (ethnic and racial) inequalities and discrimination in specific domains such as the political sphere, the labour market, or education Research about the extent to which different minorities uniformly support policies that target race or ethnicity is scarcer in Europe than in the US (Alesina et al, 2021; Scarborough et al, 2019)
  Gaddis 2018
outcomes, such as correspondence tests, with
 attitudinal data on prejudices (for exceptions, see Carlsson & Rooth 2012; Carlsson & Erikson 2017; Verhaeghe & De Coninck 2022) Previous research has shown that intended behaviour does not necessarily translate into observed behaviour We thus know little about the extent to which attitudes result in ‘real’ life’ discriminatory behaviour or threatening behaviour towards minorities (eg in the form of hate crimes); knowledge that takes a structural and cumulative perspective is particularly limited To offer a way forward, EqualStrength studies how structural prejudice across life domains is related with ‘meta discrimination’ as measured in the linked field experiments Put another
 way, EqualStrength examines to which extent outgroup prejudice corresponds with discriminatory behaviour
 PART B   8


and, even in the US, most studies focus on White Black gaps in levels of policy support (Crosby et al, 2006) Finally, we explore how minorities evaluate the impact of the Covid 19 pandemic and the economic crisis that has unfolded in terms of group level and personally experienced discrimination and hate crime Western countries saw increases in the number of hate crime attacks during 2020 21, especially against Asian migrants (Wang et al, 2021) There is also evidence that discrimination against minorities increases during periods of economic downturn (Johnston & Lordan, 2016); it is therefore possible that Muslim, Black and Roma minorities also perceive to be more
frequently the target of discriminatory and prejudicial behaviours since the pandemic

Our research design combines strong analytical rigour and conceptual precision with a multi actor, multi  domain and multi level focus We take up the gauntlet of empirically examining structural and intersectional patterns of discrimination, prejudice and hate crime, going beyond the individual level and single domain focus of the existing literature Specifically, our conceptualization and operationalization acknowledge that individuals are exposed to discrimination and forms of outgroup prejudice in multiple domains of life, often simultaneously Next to overt forms of discrimination and hostility, members of ethnic minorities routinely experience subtler forms of discrimination or are indirectly discriminated by the disparate impact of ostensibly neutral policies or regulations Through an innovative and methodologically sophisticated research program, relying on cross national and cross  setting field experiments, population based survey experiments and high quality, cross national survey data (described below in more detail), we accomplish two goals: (1) develop foundational insight into on how racism, xenophobia and discrimination are institutionalised and made structural in different European societies; and (2) map how institutional discrimination and structural racism impact the wellbeing, living conditions, and policy preferences of people with minority and migrant background across a variety of settings
132 Case selection
We opt for a diverse case study selection and examine exposure to structural racism and discrimination in countries that vary substantially in their levels of immigration, presence of Muslims and Roma in the population, ethnic gaps in unemployment rates, strength of anti discrimination legislation and policies, social measures to reconcile work and care, institutional regulation of childcare facilities and affordable housing (Ireland, UK, Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany, Switzerland, Spain, Czechia and Hungary) This range of contexts increases external validity while, at the same time, allowing us to examine whether patterns of systemic discrimination are associated with economic or institutional factors For example, inter ethnic contact theory (Pettigrew 1998) and integrated threat theory (Stephan & Stephan, 1996) lead to opposite expectations regarding the relationship between the size of the foreign born population and levels of outgroup prejudice From an institutional perspective, barriers in access to employment might be more detrimental in countries where public childcare services and affordable housing are less developed, and an adequate standard of living is only possible through active labour market participation
133 Primary data collected in EqualStrength
Linked field experiments on cumulative discrimination:
For WP2, we gather the first cross national and cross setting dataset on cumulative discrimination Data will be collected through an innovative set of linked field experiments in all nine EqualStrength countries Field experiments are regarded as the ‘golden standard’ of measuring discriminatory behaviour as they combine high external validity and experimental control (Gaddis 2018; Verhaeghe 2022) through randomization in naturally occurring contexts (Baldassarri & Abascal, 2017) The random assignment allows researchers to isolate the independent effect of each variable of interest (eg, ethnic background, parental status, gender) on the outcome When a stigmatized group is systematically treated less favourably than the non stigmatized group, those cases are interpreted as clear and convincing evidence of discrimination Table 13a shows a preliminary research design, which will be refined after desk research and consultation among the national teams to ensure cross national comparability and, at the same time, ecological validity within each country

We conceptualize and empirically analyse the cumulative nature of discrimination in four ways First, we examine cumulative discrimination across three settings: the labour market, housing market and childcare services sector We compare majority groups (ie born in the target countries with domestic sounding names) with ethnic, religious and racial minorities We chose to focus on some of the most vulnerable groups in society: Muslim minorities (in all countries except for Hungary and Czechia), Roma (only in Hungary, Czechia, and Spain, three countries where Roma are among the most stigmatized groups), and Sub Saharan Africans (in selected countries) Minority background will be signalled using foreign sounding names or common Roma names In those cases where names cannot clearly signal ethnicity (eg Roma names in Spain), additional treatments may be used We maximise direct comparability of groups across countries whenever possible The inclusion of both Muslims and sub Saharan Africans allows us to compare, within and across countries, levels of anti Muslim and anti black discrimination At the same time, the focus on the Roma group in three of the participating countries (Czechia, Hungary, Spain) provides us with the first comparative evidence on anti Roma discrimination, and its contextual variation
Second, we analyse the cumulation of risks across social identities, ie intersectional discrimination To this end, we employ a factorial and unpaired design (Di Stasio & Lancee, 2020), which allows us to randomly vary a number of characteristics, including ethnicity, gender and parental status, at once With this design, we can analyse how discrimination cumulates for individuals that carry multiple, intersecting identities as well as the risks associated with these intersections (eg minority women with a child) Next to additive and multiplicative effects  the typical focus in the study of cumulative risks  we also consider complex interaction effects such as “muted effects” (Pedulla, 2018): in such cases, a stigmatised trait (eg ethnic minority status) may mitigate rather than amplify the effect of another stigmatised identity (eg social status, proxied by the sociodemographic profile of the neighbourhood) These muted effects are likely to manifest when stereotypes are highly congruent across social positions, like belonging to a minority group and having a low socioeconomic status
Third, we identify indirect discrimination by linking the design of the setting specific field experiments To capture indirect discrimination, we vary in each setting specific field experiment characteristics that are dependent on the outcome reached by a family in another setting For example, by looking at the effect of earning status in the housing field experiment and the effect of ethnic minority status in the labour market experiment, we can test whether selection on earning status (that is, an apparently neutral practice) can disproportionately disadvantage persons of racial or ethnic origin This would be the case if real estate agents prefer dual earners but ethnic minorities face barriers in access to employment
Fourth, we calculate cumulative discrimination over time This is possible by merging the newly collected data on discrimination in the labour market with field experimental data collected between 2016 and 2017 by some of the team members as part of the GEMM project (Lancee et al 2021) The GEMM data refer to discrimination against Turkish minorities in the Netherlands and Germany, Moroccans in Spain, and Pakistani in the UK As we focus on many of the same groups in WP2, we can merge the two dataset and assess change in patterns of discrimination over time In addition, the EqualStrength fieldwork will take place in 2023 24, seven years after the GEMM data and after the Covid pandemic, which has disproportionately affected the labour market opportunities of ethnic minorities (Auer, 2022)
Cross national online survey with conjoint experiment and avoidance task:
We collect data with majority population samples in all nine EqualStrength countries (≈ 1,500 respondents per country, t=10 15 minutes) The online survey will contain a conjoint experiment, attitude measures and an avoidance task The study of prejudicial attitudes with multiple instruments (ie attitudinal questions; social distance indicators derived from a conjoint survey experiment; and underlying ethnic bias as measured in an avoidance task) is one of the main contributions of EqualStrength
For the experiment, we use a paired conjoint experiment without forced choice which Hainmueller, Hangartner and Yamamoto (2015) found to perform best when compared to a real world benchmark (thus maximising external validity) In this type of experiment, respondents are presented with a table showing the characteristics of (members of) two families These characteristics are assigned at random, which makes it difficult for the respondents to spot the precise goal of the research (thus reducing social desirability bias) We present several different experimental manipulations for each (adult) member of the family unit, which they can vary in their ethnicity, religious affiliation, race, gender, sexual orientation, health, and current housing and employment situation The final dimensions and levels will be selected based on the literature review and input from stakeholders, particularly NGOs representing minority populations Respondents will be asked to make about ten choices, so they will compare 20 different families (the exact number will be decided based on power calculations) We estimate both average marginal component effects (AMCEs; the causal effect of a given vignette attribute on respondents’ choices) and marginal
         PART B   10


means (MM, the predicted mean choice probabilities given a particular value of a vignette attribute) Leeper et al (2020) have shown that both quantities should be reported to get a complete picture of the results, and they also provide openly accessible software for this computation
When respondents are asked to select which minority family they prefer in different social domains, we rely on a modified version of the classic social distance scale (Bogardus 1947) Respondents are asked to indicate which family (or family member) they prefer as their neighbours (housing), colleague (employment), children’s classmates (school), and doctor (health care) Next, respondents indicate to what extent they think it would be pleasant to have this family/family member as their neighbour/colleague/friend of their children Furthermore, we include standard outgroup attitude measures, as well as socio demographic information on the respondents The final questions will be selected after a careful analysis of previous surveys
Moving from expressions of attitudes or behavioural intentions, to prejudice manifested in behaviour in a controlled setting, the survey contains an online avoidance task to simulated hate crime inclined behaviour conducted with MINDset, a platform for online experiments developed at one of the project partners (Essien, et al 2017) The task is based on the classic police officer's dilemma (Correll et al 2002): participants are confronted with a potentially dangerous target (ie, a person appears suddenly on the screen and is armed or unarmed) and they have to decide under time pressure whether to approach or avoid this target The ethnic group of the target varies randomly, as does the background picture in which the person appears (eg good/bad neighbourhood) Differences in reaction time reveal discriminatory behavioural tendencies towards minority and majority members that could result from stereotype activation (Cuddy et al, 2007)
Cross national online survey with minority samples:
We collect data with minority population samples in all nine EqualStrength countries (≈ 1,000 respondents per country, t=10 15 minutes) The online survey contains a vignette study and a conjoint survey experiment The minority samples include respondents who self identify as belonging to an ethnic, racialised or religious minority in each of the countries of the consortium Respondents are recruited via advertising campaigns posted in social networking sites, a method that has been increasingly used by social scientists (Del Fava et al, 2021; Zhang et al, 2020) to obtain samples of specific subgroups or hard to reach populations
Vignettes are short descriptions of situations or persons that are shown to survey respondents to elicit their judgements about specific scenarios (Atzmueller & Steiner, 2010) Vignettes vary on key dimensions that are believed to influence respondents’ judgements In our case, respondents are asked to evaluate a series of vignettes representing social interactions between majority and minority group members that may be considered as discriminatory or depictions of microaggressions Respondents rate the fairness of majority characters’ behaviours, and their agreement with minority characters’ responses or reactions portrayed in the vignette Each respondent evaluates a series of vignettes taking place in different social settings, where we vary the ethnicity/racial/religious affiliation, gender, and sexual orientation of the ethnic minority characters, as well as their reactions to the situations
The conjoint experiment captures minorities’ perception of fairness and effectiveness when faced with multi  dimensional policy choices aimed at reducing race  and ethnic based inequalities and discrimination in different domains As mentioned earlier, conjoint experiments perform best when compared to a real world benchmark and therefore increasing external validity We present respondents with some factual information about levels of discrimination or ethnic/racial inequalities in different domains (eg ‘a recent study showed that Black workers have been more economically impacted by the Covid 19 pandemic than white workers’) Afterwards, minority respondents are asked to choose among pairs of policies aimed at tackling discriminatory behaviours or inequalities based on two criteria: (1) efficiency in reducing discrimination/inequalities and (2) fairness The attributes manipulated in the experiment are the gender, ethnicity, race, or religious affiliations of the targets of discriminatory behaviour presented in the factual statements In parallel, the same respondents are presented several policy dimensions, including how targeted they are (eg ethnic quotas or ethnic sensitive selection criteria), or the extent to which the policy proposed emphasises procedural fairness (ie procedures to ensure that everybody is treated in the same way regardless of their personal characteristics)
In person survey interviews:
In Czechia and Hungary, the online survey is supplemented by in person survey interviews (~500 respondents /country, t=15 20 minutes) with the same content (vignette study and conjoint experiment) to collect information from members of the Roma community who cannot be reached via online channels This includes older and less educated Roma with limited or no access to the internet and/or limited digital skills The minority sample includes respondents who self identify as belonging to the Roma minority Respondents will be recruited via postal and personal contact in a stratified random sample of urban and rural settlements (varying in terms of the share of the Roma), by local survey agencies experienced in working with Roma samples As a starting point we intend to use EU MIDIS II’s sampling approach (FRA, 2016)
  PART B   11


Exploratory focus groups:
We conduct exploratory focus groups (Wilkinson, 1998) with members of the majority and minority populations with the objective of refining the research design of the survey instruments presented earlier We ask participants to share their experiences and views with regard to the following: (1) the presence of discrimination and racism, (2) the extent to which they consider that they are mostly the result of social structure or individual behaviours, (3) the domains where racist and discriminatory behaviours are more likely to occur, (4) how discriminatory and racist behaviours materialise in contemporary societies and (5) what the best courses of actions (at the individual and at the policy level) are to reduce the incidence of discriminatory/racist behaviours
Meso  and macro level indicators of the contextual factors of discrimination and prejudice:
To study the local and national contexts of discrimination and prejudice, we use multiple   mostly administrative   datasets Municipality data (ie, meso level) will be collected in four categories
(1) Socio demographic factors are captured by the local population size, the share, composition and type of ethnic minority groups in the municipality and local residential segregation indices Most of these data are available in public administrative datasets and access will be secured through the partners in the nine involved countries Ethnic origin can be differently measured in the different countries (Jacobs et al 2009) To capture ethnic ancestry, we first rely on the country of birth of inhabitants and  if the data allow  parental countries of birth For the local residential segregation indices (eg dissimilarity, isolation and interaction indices), we will use data on the neighbourhood level, where available
(2) Socio economic factors include local levels of unemployment and median income These data are available in public administrative datasets
(3) Supply side factors are defined by attributes like (social) housing supply, vacancy rates on the labour market and prevalence of childcare facilities The data sources are twofold: first, administrative data on, for example, social housing and recognised childcare facilities; second, we will manually collect data from relevant public websites (eg job, or childcare sites), which will also be used by WP2 to ascertain a sampling frame for the correspondence tests
(4) Socio cultural factors as measured by public attitudes towards migrants and minorities in the cross  national survey with majority samples, which include a municipality identification variable (eg postal codes) Aggregating individual survey data on attitudes to the municipality level have already been successfully applied in previous discrimination studies (Carlsson & Eriksson 2017; Verhaeghe & De Coninck 2022)
These municipality data will be translated into standardised indicators and, when required, new indicators will be constructed Additionally, factor analyses will be performed to reduce the number of indicators and avoid multicollinearity in empirical analyses We aim to follow an intersectional approach to these contextual indicators, in which multiple axes of exclusion are combined (eg unemployment figures broken down according to gender and/or ethnic origin) Finally, we also examine how the four categories of data above are interrelated For example, is there less supply of housing, job vacancies or childcare in more diverse or poor municipalities? There is also a policy dimension, ie how effective are policies such as catchment based access to schools or desegregating policies like dispersal programs?
In addition, national level data will be used to measure effects of policy context on discrimination levels We take several policy dimensions into account, such as policy inclusiveness (as conceptualised and measured with the Migrant Integration Policy Index  MIPEX  of 2020) and multiculturalism (as conceptualised and measured with the Multicultural Policy Index  MCI  of 2020) Since MCI is not yet available for Czechia and Hungary, this indicator will be constructed To measure effects of gendered family policies of welfare state regimes, we use different dimensions of the OECD Social Expenditure and Family Dataset More precise data on family policy spending is available in the European System of Integrated Social Protection Statistics database (ESSPROS) coordinated by Eurostat The contextual data will be supported with qualitative information on social protection systems regularly updated by the European Social Protection System in Member States (MISSOC)
Secondary survey data:
EqualStrength will make use of secondary survey data that includes sufficiently large minority samples and relevant questionnaire modules that consider discrimination and/or hate crime We will prioritise European cross national data sources, but country specific surveys (eg Perceived discrimination in the Netherlands II, AfroZensus in Germany) may also be used to complement the former In particular, we will rely on data from the Fundamental Rights Agency’s Second European Union Minorities and Discrimination Survey (EU MIDIS II), which collected information from over 25,500 respondents with different ethnic minority and immigrant backgrounds across all 28 EU Member States during 2017 EU MIDIS II asked minority respondents about experiences of discrimination, harassment, police stops, and rights awareness, but a limited number of minority groups are included in each of the countries Other cross  national surveys with relevant questions on perceived group level discrimination are the European Social Survey and selected special modules of the Eurobarometer

134 Previous initiatives
For WP2, we will partly rely on field experimental data gathered as part of the Growth, Equal Opportunities, Migration & Markets (GEMM) project, which received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme Four of the partners of EqualStrength took part in the GEMM project Specifically, Lancee was the work package leader of the cross national field experiment on ethnic discrimination in hiring and Di Stasio, Fernandez Reino, and Veit were the fieldwork coordinators in three of the participating countries These same countries are also included in EqualStrength, which allows for a comparison of ethnic discrimination trends over a span of about seven years (the GEMM data collection took place between 2016 and 2018, while for EqualStrength the fieldwork will take place between 2023 and 2025) The partial harmonization of the research design across projects is necessary to compare levels of discrimination at different points in time To this end, the overlap in scientific staff also guarantees knowledge sharing and a transfer of best practices in both the research design and fieldwork implementation Importantly, WP2 in EqualStrength has a much broader scope than GEMM, both in its geographical coverage and in its cross setting focus, which is crucial to examine structural discrimination
Several of the partners of EqualStrength are also co applicants of DiscrimiData, a COST action currently under review that would bring together scholars, professionals and practitioners from different sectors and disciplines (Open Call Collection OC 2021 1, Proposal Reference OC 2021 1 25593; Title: Experimental data about equity and discrimination of minorities; Main Proposer: Eva Zschirnt) The main purpose of the COST action is to create a network of experts on discrimination to coordinate future research in this field, implement comparative research designs, promote field experimental research on discrimination in countries where it does not yet exist, train future researchers (eg PhD students) and non academics in conducting experiments on discrimination, provide basis for evidence based policy recommendations If funded, the COST action would provide an excellent platform to boost our impact and dissemination strategy Already while preparing the proposal, we have laid the groundwork for a solid network of stakeholders from academia, NGOs, civil society and the policy field, some of whom have also joined EqualStrength’s advisory board We are therefore optimally positioned to guarantee a transfer of knowledge to the field and, vice versa, to gather insights from practitioners and policymakers that can inform our research plans
Many of the co applicants are involved in IMISCOE, the largest European interdisciplinary research network in the field of migration, integration and diversity studies Although IMISCOE does not have, at present, a standing committee on racism and discrimination, the co applicants are active in the organization of conferences and working groups This interdisciplinary network has strong affinities with EqualStrength’s research program and will offer a platform for exchange and dissemination
In addition, we make use of existing data about anti discrimination policies (eg, MIPEX) and multicultural policies (eg, MCI) in WP3 With respect to MCI, we will contribute to this project by adding descriptions of the multicultural policies for We may also rely on data derived from IPOLIS that has been

135 Interdisciplinary approach
Roma minority (
Czech Republic and Hungary
, 2021)
The conceptual approach, theoretical framework and research design embraces interdisciplinarity and engages with an integrate perspective that borrows perspective and methodologies from multiple disciplines In particular, our focus on forms of structural and cumulative discrimination is derived from the sociology of race We employ a strong focus on causal identification and experimental designs often found in economics We explore the subtler manifestations of prejudice and implicit bias through the use of reaction time tests, which is rooted in social psychology Our attention to a risk and resilience perspective, which considers both stressors and protective factors, is derived from the sociology of health Finally, our call for a gendered analysis of access to services in different welfare states is rooted in comparative social policy
This interdisciplinary perspective leads to new pathways forward that would otherwise remain out of reach For example, the recognition of indirect forms of discrimination and the ways in which discrimination is institutionalised made structural pushes forward the often individualised focus common to mainstream approaches in social psychology Similarly, the multilevel and cross setting approach, which is rooted in sociology, allows us to examine the ecological and external validity of socio psychological theories of outgroup derogation and ingroup favouritism For example, the analysis of how implicit bias can vary across contexts will reveal the conditions under which subtler expressions of prejudice are more likely to manifest At the same time, the attention of social psychologists to individual coping strategies to deal with stigma and perceived discrimination (in terms of identity threat, identity management, ethnic and national identification and well being) enrich sociological thinking with a focus on individual agency, thus avoiding the potential of structural racism theory to be overly deterministic (Shiao and Woody, 2021)
PART B   13
, as most recently IPOLIS developed special


Methodologically, we extend the state of the art by unique, targeted and complementary array of methods (eg, field experiments, conjoint experiments, shooter tasks) We apply these methods in innovative ways to offer unparalleled insight into the pattern and impact of cumulative disadvantage For example, we propose the first interlinked set of field experiments on cumulative discrimination across life domains Only with an integrated, cross  setting design of this kind can we measure whether ethnic, racial and religious inequalities in one domain can block opportunities in other domains Furthermore, we collect comparative data on avoidance behaviour towards different groups implementing an avoidance task in an online cross national survey, thus contextualising socio psychological theories of intergroup behaviour
136 Gender dimension
Throughout all the WPs of EqualStrength, we give gender  and its intersection with race, ethnicity, social background, sexual orientation, and parental status  a central place in the analysis More specifically, gender is experimentally varied in the field and conjoint experiments and in the avoidance task, which allows us to examine whether exposure to cumulative and structural discrimination (WP2), prejudicial attitudes toward outgroups (WP4), discrimination attributions and the coping strategies after perceiving discrimination (WP5) differ for minority men and minority women Including gender in the analysis is essential, as previous studies have found strong gendered patterns in ethnic discrimination depending on occupational gender segregation (Di Stasio & Larsen, 2020) and typically more hostile attitudes towards minority men (Gereke et al, 2020)
Importantly, we consider gender in combination with parental status An important line of sociological research has drawn attention to the vulnerable position of mothers in the workplace, in addition to the disadvantage commonly associated with gender, a phenomenon known as the motherhood penalty (Correll et al, 2007) This penalty partly results from the expectation that mothers are less competent and committed workers, a type of normative discrimination (Benard & Correll 2010) Men, on the other hand, even experience a premium for their fatherhood’s role and they are held to more lenient standards when it comes to combining work with care giving responsibilities (Kmec, 2011) The combined role of gender and parental status has only widened during the Covid  19 crisis, to an extent that scholars refer to it as a ‘gendered pandemic’ (Yavorsky et al, 2021) It is therefore of paramount importance to examine how gender and parenthood intersect in the reproduction of inequalities, both at the workplace and in other domains Importantly, for parents  and especially women  to be able to resume work after childbirth related interruptions, access to affordable childcare facilities is key
Our research extends the focus on motherhood penalties and fatherhood bonuses to minority groups On the one hand, gendered norms about ideal workers typically refer to white men and women from the ingroup (Chavez and Wingfield, 2018), meaning that expectations about workplace commitment and parental involvement may apply less strongly to minority groups On the other hand, ethnic minorities and Muslim women in particular (Khoudja & Fleischmann, 2015; Kanas & Steinmetz, 2021) have a lower labour force participation than other groups, which may also impact perceptions of their ability to combine parenthood with employment In EqualStrength, we will examine the intersection between ethnic and racial background, gender and parental status
We are well positioned, as a team, to carry out this research program Our consortium includes experts who have worked on gender and ethnic inequalities, and on their intersection, as well as on the role of family policies and gender egalitarian climates in shaping these inequalities (as we further elaborate in the section ‘Capacity of participants and consortium as a whole’)
137 Open science
EqualStrength has an ambitious data driven research plan intending to produce robust and reliable empirical evidence regarding cumulative and structural forms of discrimination, outgroup prejudice and hate crimes against ethnic, racial and religious minorities EquaStrength will adhere to the EU’s approach of making data “as open as possible, as closed as necessary”, which will be part of the Data Management Plan (DMP) We follow the guidelines established in the FAIR Data Management Guidelines for making our data ‘findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable (FAIR)’ We will also be guided by the principles outlined in the European Research Council’s Guidelines on Implementation of Open Access to Scientific Publications and Research Data and the General Data Protection Regulation For data collected through the internet, including through sampling respondents on social media and analysing existing social media content, we will be guided by the Ethical Guidelines 30 of the Association of Internet Researchers
Specifically, we intend to collect new data and use already existing data sources The expected result of our collaboration will be a series of both academic articles and more accessible publications intended for a wider audience Sharing results and empirical evidence and protocols with citizens, other researchers and agents operating in the European Research Area or in any substantive field related to our research interest is the goal of our scientific endeavour The consortium is fully aware of the importance of committing to the principles of open science, open access and open data In this section we enumerate a number of commitments we make as a consortium
PART B   14


 The crucial mandate of the Open Science logic is to make data and results open and easily available to other
 researchers and agents in the European Research Area and beyond We believe that open science is a crucial means to make science more transparent (replicable), efficient (avoiding duplication) and democratic (accessible) The consortium is built upon a network of researchers with ample experience in participating and managing EU funded projects We, thus, acknowledge and endorse the priority that the European Commission attributes to open science as the standard working method under its research funding programs In respecting the principles of open science, we seek to go beyond the simple compromise of making our results widely available through open access publications We intend to disseminate our data and results through different means, as well as the empirical protocols and materials used for data collection, above and beyond open access publications The consortium also commits to promote the
 transferability of the knowledge that will be generated
138 Data management and management of other research outputs
The academics of the consortium have a strong background in the production of data of various kinds and having all used data from third parties in many of our research and publications, we collectively share the view that the generation of both basic and applied knowledge requires the cooperation of all agents involved within the broader European Research Area It is not only in the benefit of future research projects that we aim to make our results and data widely available Making our data available to third parties can also improve science society relationships We understand that the dissemination of our results and the visibility of EqualStrength as well as of the consortium members requires full transparency in both the methods used to produce our evidence, our data, and any material and procedure involved in the analysis
A specific data management plan (DMP) will be developed as part of WP1 and agreed upon at the start of the project The DMP will be validated by all consortium members during the kick off meeting The WP1 leader ensures that this plan aligns with the FAIR principles ('Findability', 'Accessibility', 'Interoperability' and 'Reusability') of Open Science The first DMP will be delivered to the Commission by month 6 As suggested by the Commission, this plan will be updated and revised by the end of the project with a detailed reporting of any innovations and modifications made to the original plan In addition to this generic compromise to formulate a data management plan at the start of our collaboration, we would like to make a number of explicit commitments to make our data available, identifiable and citable, and to grant user friendly access and preservation over time This applies to all kinds of data produced in the context of the project, including field experiments, online surveys, contextual and policy data and qualitative data (see Table 18a) These data will be consolidated into five different datasets Four of these datasets will be deposited for public use, and pre registered in the case of experimental data The data collected from the exploratory focus groups will not be publicly disseminated The coordination and management team, based at UCD, will be in charge of security, confidentiality and ethical issues in terms of data management The procedures for data cleaning, security, and quality assurance will be thoroughly described in the DMP

          Making our data available: The anonymised datasets are deposited in repositories certified by Data Seal of Approval, so other researchers respecting all four FAIR principles in the context of the EOSC and global drive towards Open Science can use them We also publish our empirical protocols (syntax and programs used to analyse data) together with any featured result in GitHub to facilitate replication This also applies to metadata or underlying data, raw data and any information needed to validate the results, including analysis protocols and any relevant documentation and background information regarding the production of our data We use the Creative Commons CC0 waiver for open access to data
Data identification and citation: To ensure that data is easily identifiable by potential users in the future, we provide our datasets with persistent identifiers or PIDS such as DOI, Handle, PURL, URN: NBN We rely on official repositories certified by Data Seal of Approval (European Open Science Cloud, and federated repositories such as Research Data Netherlands, DIGITALCSIC in Spain, and the UK Data Archive), selecting those allowing the deposit and/or downloading of data free of charge Consequently, data are disseminated with robust identifiers instead of URLs, which can be unstable over time
User friendly and safe data formats that will allow preservation and interoperability: EqualStrength datasets are stored in the most popular and accessible formats; plain text files will be used for backups The data will be deposited in separate files corresponding to the national samples and a cumulative harmonised data file for cross  national analysis
Accessible research results: the consortium complies with the open science recommendations of early sharing our main results The project website will be the main communication channel for the communication of research outputs, including working papers, country reports, policy recommendations and press releases Pre prints and working papers will also be published in online paper servers such as SocArXiv The consortium will also make use of ORE, the open access publishing platform of the European Commission
Reproducible and robust research results: As explained in the excellence section, EqualStrenth ensures reproducibility of its research output through a transparent research design and methodology With regard to the experimental data generated in WP2, WP4, and WP5, we will pre register the hypotheses and research design prior to any data collection We also aim at making data robustness checks and complementary online materials available to the research community
Co design, co creation and co assessment: the EqualStrength consortium provides means for citizens and stakeholders to participate in research designs and to incorporate their views into our research tools Specifically, WP4 and WP5 will conduct exploratory focus groups that feed into the research design The Stakeholders Committee and Advisory Board broadens the consortium’s expertise and facilitates early engagement with key audiences, in particular civil society organisations and policymakers, which not only actively participate in the early design phases but also throughout the project
139 Ethics (technical annex)
Use of human subjects, informed consent and deception:
As introduced in the ethics self assessment, participants in field experiments are selected and informed consent is infeasible as it would compromise the veracity of responses to a given candidate’s application/contact Post hoc informing of participants is also infeasible as the individual responses are anonymised so that no link remains between correspondence and the participant As a result, the initial receipt, review and response to a candidate’s profile involves deception To address the resulting ethical concerns, where relevant, a public debriefing will be employed This approach does not provide any direct links between those who responded to the candidate’s details and the employer/line manager as that has the potential for negative consequences
The public debriefing approach involves two mechanisms First, using the contact details which are retained but not linked to individual responses, all participants will be informed of the objectives of study and the publicly reported results In this way, the information about the broader pattern will be known and an understanding of the

way in which the data was collected will be conveyed to all participants Second, an individual debriefing report will be provided if participants seek additional details upon being informed via the public report In the latter case, the general results will be coupled with a clear explanation of the methods used and, moreover, the fact that all data is permanently anonymised such that no links can ever be drawn between participants and treatment of candidate profiles
It is worth mentioning that these ethical concerns are not unique to the approach taken in this proposal The approach is needed as field experiments, correspondence studies and audit studies, like those proposed here, are considered to be one of the only valid methods to ascertain unbiased evidence of discriminatory behaviour There is a demonstrable track record in social science research in disciplines such as economics (eg Bertrand and Mullainathan 2004; Neumark et al 2019), political science (eg Butler and Crabtree 2017), social psychology (eg Carpusor and Loges 2006, Feldman and Weseley 2013), social policy (eg Darolia et al 2015), and sociology (eg Rodriguez Menes and Rovira 2019) Hundreds of in person and online audit studies have been conducted over the past 50 years across many Western countries (Baert 2018; Quillian et al 2019) These studies have similarly confronted the ethical challenges of conducting studies of discrimination based on field experiments Drawing from this record in the literature, the proposed research will deploy clear ethical protocols to mitigate concerns These include institutional review at each member institution, experience of the leads/partners, inclusivity of NGOs and policymakers (through the Advisory Board and Stakeholders Group), adherence to all relevant legislation (eg GDPR) and involvement of a Data Protection Officer at each institution tasked with data collection
Processing of personal data and vulnerable individuals/groups:
The ethics self assessment covered in some detail the process of anonymising and storing of data To avoid too much repetition, the key details are condensed to the following:
 Both experimental and survey data will be immediately anonymised and stored according to highest data protection standards defined in a Data Management Plan developed at the lead institution (UCD)
 Only data that are required for meeting the research objectives will be collected
 We guarantee confidentiality of the data and the minimal inconvenience imposed on the research participants
In all field experiments, inconvenience to participants and applicants are minimised by all offers of interview
or employment being promptly and politely declined
 Ethnicity data is queried in the surveys (WP3, WP4, WP5) and will be collected within parameters defined by
relevant GDPR that pertains to highly sensitive personal data No minors are included in the data collection, but minority survey respondents can constitute vulnerable people in some cases
 In all instances, the data collection will comply with country specific ethics requirements In non EU countries (ie, UK and Switzerland), research procedures will comply with EU legislations on Ethics and Data Protection (2021)
Further processing of previously collected personal data: all previously collected survey data will accessed
via publicly available data archives No individual information will be used at any stage of the secondary data analysis
Transfer of personal data to and from non EU countries: the consortium includes two non EU members (ie, United Kingdom and Switzerland) The data collection will comply with country specific ethics requirements in each country where it is collected In addition, non EU countries (ie, UK and Switzerland) will comply with EU legislations on Ethics and Data Protection (2021) In sum, all data will be collected, processed and stored in a lawful, fair and transparent way, conforming to the principle of data minimisation set by EU guidelines
Table 13c Ethical issues, by WP
 As mentioned in the Ethics Self Assessment (PART A), in Germany and Switzerland it is customary to include
 documents such as vocational or school qualifications in an application There will be context specific approaches developed with the relevant legal bodies In the case of Germany, the Federal Anti Discrimination body commissioned a legal expertise on how this can be addressed in compliance with German legislation (Kühn et al, 2013) A similar, but unpublished, expertise on the legality of correspondence testing and the use of documents also exists for Switzerland, which will be the reference In sum, no stigmatisation or negative consequences are foreseen
 in the collection, analysis and dissemination of results
  the GDPR, a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) will be conducted in line with Article 35 GDPR and we will closely collaborate with the Data Protection Officers (DPOs) of the respective institutions and the lead (UCD) to guarantee adherence to guidance on data privacy issues In addition, we include partnerships with

21 Project’s pathways towards impact
EqualStrength fully responds to the expected outcomes detailed in the topic HORIZON CL2 2022  TRANSFORMATIONS 01 08 (‘Strengthening racial, ethnic and religious equality') and to the wider impacts detailed in the Horizon Europe Strategic Plan 2021 2024 In particular, the project seeks to inform the development of evidence based policies and to produce policy recommendations that help fight discrimination and racism; enhance social fairness; and tackle inequalities to achieve a more inclusive society, including in response to the socio  economic challenges related to the COVID 19 pandemic
The findings of EqualStrength will be of relevance to five target audiences: (1) academics across a range of disciplines in the social sciences, in particular sociologists, demographers, economists and social psychologists investigating racism, discrimination, and prejudice; (2) policymakers at government agencies and other public bodies, with portfolios related to social inclusion, social cohesion, integration and anti discrimination, both at the local and the national level; (3) civil society organisations, such as NGOs and think tanks fighting against racism and for the improvement of the living conditions of ethnic, racial and religious minorities; as well as trade associations, such as employers’ or landlords’ associations; (4) media practitioners in traditional print, broadcast, and online outlets; and (5) the public at large, ie both the majority population and minorities who self identify as belonging to an ethnic, racialised and/or religious group Table 21a summarises the main audiences that EqualStrength will target with the dissemination and communication activities detailed in section 22

   212 Wider scientific and societal impacts of EqualStrength
The expected wider impacts of EqualStrength’s have guided the overall design and research objectives of the project In this section we outline the scientific and societal impacts that we expect to achieve based on the project’s research outputs Most of the expected impacts described below will likely materialise near or at the end of the project Note, however, that not all impacts (whether scientific or societal) of a project of this magnitude will be measurable or directly attributable to the project
In terms of scientific impacts, we expect EqualStrength to (1) create authoritative evidence based knowledge that shapes the scholarly debate on discrimination and racism in Europe; (2) improve the methodological knowledge regarding the application of a range of experimental and observational methods to the study of discrimination and racism; (3) launch and consolidate the research career of junior social scientists in different European institutions; and (4) consolidate interdisciplinary networks which will materialise in follow up research projects and funding In table 21b, we outline the expected scientific impacts and propose indicators to monitor their achievement

     With regard to the wider societal impacts of the project (Table 21c), we expect that the outcomes of EqualStrength contribute to a more inclusive and egalitarian European society by (1) raising public awareness about the effects of
 structural racism and discrimination on the life opportunities and wellbeing of ethnic, religious and racialised minorities; (2) establishing knowledge exchange networks between the academics in the consortium and policymakers working in the areas of social inclusion and anti discrimination policies; and (3) collaborating with civil society organisations and government officials in the design and implementation of new programmes or initiatives aimed at reducing discrimination and/or mitigating its negative impacts

      Partnership with policymakers or NGOs to implement interventions, policies and campaigns to reduce discrimination and racism, and/or mitigate their impacts
  213 Potential barriers to societal impact
A challenge that researchers and civil society organisations face when addressing discrimination and racism is the often polarised and, sometimes, simplistic positions within media, policy and public audiences, who will often seek out narratives and stories that reaffirm their existing opinions on a given topic (Iyengar et al, 2009; Bakshy et al 2015) EqualStrength will rely on the extensive experience of their members and universities’ communications teams to convey the project’s research findings in a clear and objective manner in order to reach a diverse set of audiences
An additional challenge is to ensure that the findings of the project are effectively translated to different non  academic audiences, avoiding academic jargon, excessive information and non essential technical details Communicating research findings in an easily understood format without oversimplification can be a challenge for many academics However, the members of the consortium have extensive experience in media outreach and translating research to non academic audiences The consortium will also rely on the expertise of the Advisory Board and Stakeholders Group, which will provide essential and continuous guidance on the interpretability of the project’s findings and the most appropriate means for their communication
22 Measures to maximise impact   Dissemination, exploitation and communication
We will maximise the impact and dissemination of the project’s findings through the Plan for dissemination and exploitation, which also includes the project’s communication activities This plan, coordinated in WP6, aims to maximise impact by engaging with the target audiences during and after the lifetime of the project In doing so, we will make sure that EqualStrength’s findings reach the target audience through the most effective distribution channels and produce lasting uptake
221 Dissemination and exploitation plan
The objective of the dissemination and exploitation plan will be to effectively communicate the results of EqualStrength so that they can be exploited by the project’s target audiences The exploitation of EqualStrength’s outputs is thus the foundation for its impact on policy, scholarship and society at large
Project materials and research outputs will be accessible to members of the public online via the project’s website The most effective approach for dissemination to the public at large will take place through the four audiences described earlier (academics, policymakers, civil society organisations, and media) These four audiences will therefore be the focus of the project’s strategic outreach work Table 22a presents the main dissemination products, and the audiences we aim to target with each of them

 The data management plan to be submitted on month 6 will specify the schedule and modalities of data release, taking into consideration the privacy of informants, the benefits of open data, and the protection of project generated analysis As announced in the Open Science section in the Excellence part of this application, the Consortium is aware of the importance of early sharing results as well as any other research material that will allow the replication of our results (program and syntax, research protocols) The experimental research design and experimental research tools will be pre registered accordingly to allow for replication and to avoid misusing our evidence (serendipity) or generating post hoc hypotheses after results are known (harking) At the same time, we acknowledge the labour  intensive nature of the data collections in WP2, WP4, and WP5 To guarantee an adequate time frame for publishing results generated as part of EqualStrength, we propose an embargo from the end of the project before the data will be deposited in digital repositories This option is a fair compromise between ensuring intellectual ownership of the key results of the project and promoting open science practices

possible, we will encourage the open development of our outputs and provide explicit permission to redevelop with attribution
224 Continued impact of EqualStrength after month 36
Many of the wider scientific and societal impacts mentioned in section 212 will occur at or after month 36 With regard to EqualStrength’s scientific impacts, we expect to publish most of the articles in high impact journals between 12 and 36 months after the end of the project This is because the publication timelines of academic journals are considerably slow, and in many cases authors wait up to 2 years from submission until final publication (assuming that the article is not desk rejected) Likewise, follow up research projects will likely occur after month 36, as the members of the consortium may find it difficult to invest enough time in writing high quality research proposals during the duration of this project However, we will apply for impact funding opportunities between month 24 and 36 This type of funding is available to academics in most research institutions, and its objectives are to maximise the societal impact of an existing project and support knowledge exchange activities
In terms of societal impacts, the stakeholder engagement as well as the dissemination and communication activities conducted during the project will allow us to consolidate knowledge exchange networks with policymakers and civil society organisations that will remain active after month 36 These networks will facilitate future collaborations between the consortium and non academic partners in the topic of this call, which will sustain the impact of the EqualStrength beyond the lifespan of the project

23 Summary
KEY ELEMENT OF THE IMPACT SECTION
  SPECIFIC NEEDS
   EXPECTED RESULTS
   D & E & C MEASURES
   What are the specific needs that triggered this project?
Structural discrimination and racism towards Muslim, Black and Roma minorities in European countries are difficult to measure and poorly understood
Knowledge of intersectional discrimination and outgroup hostility is limited; some axes of inequality (eg sexual orientation; family status) are rarely studied in combination with ethnic background
Theoretical approaches need contextualisation: local and national policies and institutions may mitigate or exacerbate minorities’ exposure to disadvantage
Current approaches neglect the cumulation of risks across settings, multiple stigmatised statuses, over time, and within families
  What do you expect to generate by the end of the project?
New knowledge exchange networks with policymakers and NGOs working on the areas of social inclusion and anti discrimination
New interdisciplinary academic networks
Dataset with the results of three linked field experiments measuring cumulative discrimination (across life domains and from an intersectional lens) against Muslim, Black and Roma minorities in 9 European countries
Dataset on indicators of prejudice and hostile behaviour with representative samples of 9 European countries’ populations
Dataset on minorities’ interpretation of discriminatory situations, coping strategies and policy preferences in 9 European countries

Management and coordination
WP1Objectives:
11 Monitor progress and ensure coordination across WP leaders and country teams 12 Provide technical expertise across different WPs
13 Establish, coordinate, inform and collect feedback from the Advisory Board
14 Creation and maintenance of project website
15 Coordination and submission of Interim and Final Reports
16 Coordinate Kick off and Final in person conferences
17 Ensure compliance with standards for research ethics
18 Develop and monitor the Data Management Plan (DMP)
19 Manage Intellectual Property Rights resulting from the project
WP1Description of work:
The management of a ten institution consortium requires consistent and structured coordination with WP leaders, country teams, partner administrative support, project officers and relevant financial auditing agencies This entails a mixture of technical and research support, financial compliance, ethics guidance and data management
The first objective is to monitor the overall progress of the project, adhering to the clearly defined and agreed  upon timelines The Project Leader (Mathew Creighton), postdoctoral researcher (Daniel Capistrano), and the UCD based PhD and Project Manager constitute the Management and Coordination Team (MCT)
Task 111 The Project Leader will form the Research Committee in month 1 The Research Committee will facilitate the coordination activities across the WPs, and dissemination of the findings and communication activities The Project Leader will ensure regular communication between the members of the consortium by organising quarterly video calls between relevant WP leaders This will maximise data exchange and ensure that deadlines are met
The second objective is to provide technical support across work packages
Task 121 involves the recruitment of a doctoral candidate into the PhD programme in Complex Systems and Computational Social Science to engage in best practices for online survey experiments and automated approaches to field experiments This is an area of interest at the intersection of computational social science and more traditional, probability based sampling/data collection, which offers a clear academic advantage that can be shared across WPs
The third objective is to establish, coordinate, inform and collect feedback from the Advisory Board
Task 131 The Advisory Board will be convened to broaden the project’s expertise and ensure early engagement with key audiences
Task 132 Ensure communication between the Research Committee and Advisory Board
The fourth objective is the creation and maintenance of the project website, which is key to support the project’s impact and dissemination strategy, which is the focus of WP6 In addition to offering a reference and platform to share and understand the project, the website will be the key access point for archived material related to the progress, ethics and the Data Management Plan (DMP)
Task 141 Development and hosting of a well presented website with clear and accessible design elements that reflect best practices in terms of inclusive design
Task 142 Develop the submission and dissemination protocols for an accessible repository of summary reports, annual financial documents (within legal guidelines), all ethics documentation and the project’s Data Management Plan (DMP)
The fifth objective is the coordination and submission of the Interim and Final Reports
Task 151 Coordination of Interim Report 1
Task 152 Coordination of Interim Report 2
Task 153 Coordination of Final Report
The sixth objective is the organisation of the Kick off and Final conferences that will offer a much needed in  person interaction for the consortium partners The MCT, in coordination with the Budapest Institute, will organise two in person conferences held at month 3 and 30 in Budapest

                     PART B   29


Task 161 Organisation of Kick off Conference, which will ensure clarity regarding financial and administrative requirements, enable in depth discussions of the project’s topics, and facilitate the organisation of a cohesive dissemination and communications strategy
Task 162 Organisation of the Final Conference, to share findings from the field, present reports, and plan for the post project continuity in terms of impact and dissemination, the core of WP6
The seventh objective is the coordination of ethics requirements, including the compulsory ethics deliverables Ethics is a core concern of data collection that engages with potentially vulnerable groups The primary ethics responsibility remains at the institution where the fieldwork is being conducted, but the MCT and the Research Committee will offer advice and establish best practices when an ethical consideration includes multiple work packages
The eighth objective is related to data management The MCT, in coordination with the Research Committee, will develop a complete Data Management Plan (DMP) The DMP will include (1) a data description and collection or re use of existing data, (2) documentation and guarantee of data quality, (3) details on the storage and backup during the research process, (4) description of the Legal and ethical requirements and relevant codes of conduct and, finally, (5) guidelines for data sharing and long term archival needs
Task 181 Development of a written DMP by month 6, which will be archived on and available through the project website, hosted at UCD
The ninth objective is management of Intellectual Property Rights (IPRs) resulting from the project
Task 191 Addressing the IPRs in the Consortium Agreement

Measuring cumulative discrimination with field experiments across settings
WP2Objectives:
21 Measure cumulative discrimination levels across settings
22 Compare cumulative discrimination across countries
23 Examine intersectional discrimination (by gender, parental and flexible employment status) 24 Identify indirect discrimination
25 Compare employment discrimination longitudinally
WP2Description of work:
The first objective is to measure systemic exposure to discrimination across different settings (employment, housing, childcare) and calculate a measure of cumulative discrimination Both conceptually and methodologically, our operationalisation of discrimination as a systemic and cumulative process improves on current scholarship that focuses on single events and settings in isolation
Task 211 Reviewing the literature on discrimination, distinguishing between the different settings where discrimination takes place
Task 212 Harmonising the research design for the linked field experiments across countries and settings and preparing the experimental protocols and materials (CVs, cover letters, email inquiries)
Task 213 Collecting data in 9 countries, tracking the municipality and neighbourhoods where inquiries to employers, landlords and childcare administrators are sent (to connect with WP3 data)
Task 214 Harmonising the resulting dataset, with comparable callback indicators across settings and countries Task 215 Analysing the data (calculating discrimination ratios by setting and comparing discrimination across settings in each country) and producing the papers listed as deliverables
The second objective is to compare setting specific discrimination across countries WP2 will deliver the most ambitious field experiment on discrimination ever conducted, for both its geographical scope (9 countries, including Hungary and the Czech Republic, thus redressing the Western bias of the available literature) and cross setting focus We will (1) compare levels of discrimination across countries characterised by widely different institutional arrangements, economic conditions, immigration histories and welfare policies; (2) identify whether levels of discrimination are consistent across domains; and (3) calculate a composite ethnic discrimination score by country that averages discrimination ratios across settings, to obtain a measure of cumulative, cross setting discrimination
Task 221 Merging field experimental data across all participating countries
Task 222 Analysing the data and producing the papers listed as deliverables
The third objective is to examine discrimination in access to employment, housing and childcare from an intersectional perspective We do so by focusing on differences in discrimination levels by gender, parental status

                  PART B   30


and flexible employment
Task 231 Reviewing the literature on intersectional discrimination, distinguishing between various forms of intersectionality
Task 232 Analysing the data with a focus on the relevant interaction effects (ie, between gender and ethnic background, parental status and ethnic background and flexible employment and ethnic background) and producing the papers listed as deliverables
The fourth objective is to examine the interrelated dependencies between unfair treatment in one setting and the outcomes attained in another We will map the conceptual differences in the use of different terms (eg indirect discrimination, structural discrimination, institutional discrimination, systemic discrimination) and the methodological challenges that arise when trying to disentangle one type of discrimination from the other, with a focus on indirect forms of discrimination This is necessary to examine the processes through which minorities experience unequal access to opportunities over and beyond direct individual discrimination on single settings Task 241 Reviewing the literature on indirect, structural and institutional discrimination
Task 242 Analysing the data with a focus on indirect forms of discrimination and producing the papers listed as deliverables
The fifth objective is to compare changes (or stability) in levels of ethnic discrimination over time For this analysis we will focus on the domain of employment only Between 2016 and 2018, several of the principal investigators have collected the first large scale and cross nationally harmonised field experimental data on ethnic discrimination in five European labour markets, as part of the Horizon 2020 funded GEMM project A sub sample of the GEMM data will be merged with part of the newly collected field experimental data from WP2 to measure exposure to cumulative discrimination over time We will focus on the four European countries (Germany, Netherlands, Spain, UK) and the origin groups (Turkish, Moroccans, Pakistani) for which comparable field experimental data are available in both the GEMM project and WP2
Task 251 Harmonising the design of the employment field experiment with the design of the GEMM field experiment and calculation of callback rates
Task 252 Merging the data collected in Germany, the Netherlands, Spain and the UK with the GEMM data collected in 2016 18 in the same countries and targeting the same ethnic groups
Task 253 Analysing the data with a focus on over time changes in exposure to discrimination and producing the papers listed as deliverables

Policy and institutional contexts of discrimination   A multilevel approach
WP3Objectives:
31 To examine the role of local level contextual factors on rental, hiring and childcare discrimination
32 To investigate how discrimination levels in both hiring, rental and childcare access differ according to existing policies and legislation at the national level
33 To compare discrimination levels in hiring, rental and childcare access according to the gendered family policies of different welfare state regimes
34 To examine whether the effects of the above mentioned policy and institutional factors differ across domains and/or between minority groups
WP3Description of work:
The first objective is to analyse to which extent rental, hiring and childcare discrimination  as measured with correspondence tests in WP2  differs according to contextual factors at the local level In the selection of contextual factors, we rely on theories and empirical studies about anti immigrant attitudes, interethnic relations and discrimination An elaborate discussion of all theories and studies, their mechanisms and how they will be measured is outside the scope of this proposal, but we will examine contextual factors in four categories: 1) Socio demographic factors, such as local population size, the share, composition and type of ethnic minority groups in the municipality and local residential segregation indices; 2) Socio economic factors, such as local levels of unemployment and median income; 3) Supply side factors, such as (social) housing supply, vacancy rates on the labour market and childcare facilities; 4) Socio cultural factors, such as aggregated attitudes towards migrants and minorities as measured in WP4 For each category of indicators, the objective is subdivided into three tasks
Task 311 is to review the literature on institutional effects on discrimination and apply them to the local level Task 312 is to assemble and manage the necessary data at the municipality level across the nine countries

             PART B   31


involved These municipality data will be translated into standardised indicators and  if necessary  new indicators will be constructed The new dataset will be merged with the correspondence tests data from WP2 Task 313 is to examine both linear and non linear associations of municipality indicators with discrimination rates on the housing and labour market and in childcare through multilevel analyses
The second objective focusses on the policy context of discrimination at the national level in order to understand how discrimination in hiring, housing and childcare differ according to existing policies and legislation on anti  discrimination, inclusiveness and multiculturalism The correspondence test data on discriminatory behaviour from WP2 will be cross nationally compared against the background of the different national policies towards minorities and discrimination We will consider policy inclusiveness (as conceptualised and measured with the Migrant Integration Policy Index MIPEX  of 2020) and multiculturalism (as conceptualised and measured with the Multicultural Policy Index  MCI  of 2020)
Task 321 is to review the literature on policy inclusiveness and multiculturalism and their (different) potential effects on discrimination in housing, hiring and childcare
Task 322 is to describe existing policies towards minorities and discrimination by means of MIPEX and MCI Since MCI is not yet available for Czechia and Hungary, this indicator will be constructed with support from Charles University (CZ) and Budapest Institute (HU)
Task 323 is to compare discrimination levels  as measured in WP2  according to the policy dimensions of the previous task
The third objective is to measure the effects of family policies in different welfare state regimes on discrimination in housing, labour market and childcare National family and gender policies play a crucial role in countering institutionalised discrimination, eg labour market participation crucially depends on the family situation and exposure to discrimination in domains that affect their activation, eg access to childcare services and housing Several policy dimensions will be considered based on the OECD Social Expenditure and Family Dataset
Task 331 is to review the literature on gendered family policies of different welfare state regimes and their potential consequences for ethnic discrimination of families
Task 332 is to describe the current family policies of the nine countries involved in the project, with a special focus on the labour and housing market and childcare, using the OECD data as a starting point
Task 333 is to compare the discrimination levels as measured in WP2 across to the policies of the previous task
The fourth objective is to examine the extent to which the above mentioned policies and institutional effects at local and national levels differ between life domains and/or minority groups We will investigate whether institutional factors and policies are consistent across the housing, labour market and childcare domains In addition, contextual effects might also differ with respect to discrimination against Muslim, Black and/or Roma minorities This results in task 341: writing an overview report which integrates and compares the insights of the three previous WP objectives

Prejudice and xenophobia among the majority population
WP4Objectives:
41 To examine how prevalent prejudice, xenophobia and negative attitudes towards different minority groups are among the majority population in different countries
42 To investigate the extent to which the level of prejudice against different minority groups varies across life domains
43 To apply an intersectional approach to the study of prejudice
44 To examine how prejudice and xenophobic attitudes translate into behaviour (eg hate crimes)
WP4Description of work:
The main objective of WP4 is to study the prejudice and xenophobia of the majority populations from a cross  national and intersectional perspective, taking the target of hostility as the starting point One of the main contributions of WP4 innovative research design is the measurement of prejudice with different instruments, ie first, attitudinal indicators used in secondary survey data; secondly, social distance indicators derived from a conjoint survey experiment, where respondents evaluate a ‘target’ minority family which varies in the ethnicity, religious affiliation, and sexual orientation of their members; thirdly, national statistics on hate crime; and finally,

           PART B   32


an experimental avoidance game measuring respondents’ reacting times to armed and unarmed targets WP4 has four major objectives:
The first objective is to examine how levels of prejudice towards different minority groups vary among the majority population WP4 will analyse cross national secondary survey data on racism, xenophobia and attitudes towards minorities; that will provide contextual indicators on attitudes towards minorities at the municipality level, which will then be included in WP3 contextual dataset
Task 411 Data inventory of cross national and national surveys on racism, xenophobia and attitudes towards minority groups
Task 412 Merging data on attitudes towards minorities from existing European and national surveys covering key life domains, to create indicators at the lowest geographical level
Task 413 Connect attitude indicators of task 412 to the municipality indicators collected in WP3 and to field experimental data (WP2)
Task 414 Investigate over time change in attitudes (eg in relation to the refugee crisis of 2015 or the Covid19 pandemic)
The second objective is to investigate the hierarchies of prejudice in multiple countries and across life domains, based on primary survey data including a conjoint experiment Relying on the ‘fictitious family’ presented in WP2, we study how families’ characteristics (ethnicity, race, sexual orientation and religious affiliation of their members) condition respondents’ perceived social distance towards those families in different social settings Task 421 Data inventory of cross national and national conjoint experiments measuring prejudice, to not only identify individual studies focusing on one country and/or domain, but to enlarge both the geographical focus as well as the minority groups addressed in these studies
Task 422 Conduct an online survey with representative samples of the population of 9 countries, which will include different indicators aimed at capturing respondents’ prejudicial attitudes (general attitude questions and a conjoint survey experiment to measure social distance)
The third objective is to apply an intersectional approach to the study of prejudice, which allows us to go beyond the identification of ethnic hierarchies in each of the 9 countries In doing so, we will examine how minority’s ethnicity and religion combine with other axes of inequality (gender, sexual orientation, migrant origin) to shape respondents’ evaluations of minority families (or family members) in different social settings We will also examine how respondents’ characteristics affect their evaluations
Task 431 Analyse how respondents’ characteristics shape their answers to the attitudinal questions and conjoint experiment
Task 432 In the conjoint experiment, investigate how respondents’ prejudicial beliefs are shaped by different combinations of minority families’ characteristics
Task 433 Compare intersectionality of prejudicial attitudes across domains with the results of field experiments in WP2
The fourth objective is to examine how prejudice and xenophobic attitudes translate into specific behaviours, including hate crimes Here, the focus will be to examine how members of the majority behave towards members of minority groups, with hate crimes being one of the most extreme behavioural manifestations of prejudice Next to the minority groups mentioned above, we also include minorities particularly affected by hate crimes such as refugees, Roma, and, given the recent rise in Anti Asian hate crimes due to the Covid 19 pandemic, East Asian minorities To assess this empirically, we make use of an experimental avoidance task embedded in the cross  national survey mentioned in objective 42
Task 441 Review the literature on hate crime
Task 442 Assemble data from existing government statistics on hate crimes against the specified minority groups in the countries covered in this project Data collection should focus on at least the last 10 years to analyse how recent events, such as the 2015 refugee crisis, or the Covid 19 pandemic, are reflected in the number of hate crimes towards specific minority groups
Task 443 Conduct an online avoidance task in which participants are confronted with potentially dangerous targets and are asked to decide under time pressure whether to approach or avoid the target   with the targets belonging either to the majority group or to the respective minority groups (embedded in cross national survey of task 422)

Perceptions of racism and discrimination: minorities’ policy preferences and coping strategies across domains
    PART B   33


WP5Objectives:
51 To identify the individual and contextual correlates of minorities’ perceptions of personal and group discrimination and hate crime
52 To analyse the relationship between minorities’ perceptions of discrimination reported in surveys and ‘objective’ measures of discrimination provided by field experiments across social domains in European countries 53 To analyse the conditions under which minorities are more likely to attribute majority group’s behaviour to prejudice or discrimination, as well as their preferred coping strategy to manage those behaviours
54 To analyse minorities’ degree of support for race or ethnic targeted policies and interventions
55 To examine the extent to which the Covid 19 pandemic has had a negative impact on minorities’ experiences and perceptions of discrimination
56 To analyse the relationship between minorities’ perceptions of discrimination and subjective wellbeing in different national contexts
WP5Description of work:
WP5 focuses on minorities’ perceptions of personal and group discrimination and hate crime, including microaggressions; their coping strategies; and their policy preferences to reduce ethnic and racial inequalities that are the product of cumulative discrimination As in WP2 and WP4, the focus is on Muslim, Black and Roma minorities in nine European countries (UK, Ireland, the Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, Spain, Switzerland, Hungary, and Czech Republic) Three different types of data will feed the research design and empirical analysis of WP5: firstly, data from exploratory focus groups with members of ethnic, racial, and religious minorities in the countries of the consortium; secondly, cross national secondary survey data (and, when available, national survey data) with large enough minority samples and a module on discrimination and/or hate crime; and finally, primary data from a cross national survey
The first objective is to identify the individual and contextual correlates of minorities’ perceptions of personal and group discrimination and hate crime Based on cross national and national survey secondary data, the aim is to increase the knowledge about the individual and contextual factors that increase the propensity to report in surveys direct experiences of discrimination, general perceptions of discrimination against respondents’ (ethnic) group, and hate crime, as well as the reasons for those (eg ethnic , racial , or religion based discrimination and hate crime) Task 511 Data inventory of cross national and national surveys over sampling ethnic and/or migrant communities which include modules on discrimination, hate crime and/or microaggressions
Task 512 Merging data on perceptions of discrimination and hate crime from existing surveys to create indicators (if possible) at the municipality level, which will feed WP3
Task 513 Analysis of differences in perceptions and reasons for discrimination and hate crime between and within minority groups in relevant across social domains
Task 514 Analysis of the role of local level contextual factors (from WP3 and WP4) on perceptions of discrimination and hate crime
The second objective is to improve the understanding of the relationship between minorities’ perceptions of discrimination reported in surveys and ‘objective’ measures of discrimination provided by field experiments across social domains in European countries Here the focus will be to compare the field experimental data on discrimination in housing and the labour market collected in WP2 with minorities’ perceptions and experiences of discrimination in those domains as reported in secondary survey data
Task 521 Analysis of field experimental data collected in WP2 with cross national secondary survey data on perceptions of discrimination
The third objective is to improve our understanding about the conditions under which minorities are more likely to attribute majority group’s behaviour to prejudice or discrimination, as well as their preferred coping strategy to manage those behaviours It is based on a vignette study, where minority respondents will be asked to interpret a range of realistic scenarios depicting interactions between members of the majority and minority groups as microaggressions or discriminatory situations
Task 531 Refinement of research design of vignette study based on literature review and input from focus groups with minority participants and stakeholders
Task 532 Design of the social networking sites’ advertising campaign to recruit survey minority participants for the cross national online survey
Task 533 Survey data collection, cleaning and preparation for analysis
Task 534 Data analysis
The fourth objective is to increase the knowledge of minorities’ degree of support for race or ethnic targeted policies and interventions
Based on a conjoint survey experiment, minority respondents will evaluate different policies aimed at reducing or mitigating the consequences of discrimination and racism in terms of perceived fairness and effectiveness

Task 541 Refinement of research design of conjoint experiment based on literature review and input from focus groups with minority participants and stakeholders
Task 542 Survey data collection, cleaning and preparation for analysis
Task 543 Data analysis
The fifth objective is to investigate the extent to which the Covid 19 pandemic has increased negative minorities’ perceptions of discrimination
The minority survey will include questions about the perceived impacts of the pandemic on minorities’ experiences of personal and group discrimination and racism
The sixth objective is to examine the impact of perceived discrimination on minorities’ self reported wellbeing In order to analyse this relationship, we will rely on cross national secondary survey data such as the EU MIDIS II, which includes modules on discrimination across different life domains, and questions on respondents’ mental health and wellbeing

Task 611 is to develop a plan for dissemination and exploitation including communication activities
Task 612 is the constitution of the Stakeholders Group, which will include policymakers and representatives of NGOs (and trade associations, when possible)
The second objective is to ensure that the input of stakeholders’  in particular, the priorities and views of policymakers and NGOs advocating for minority populations  informs the research design of WP2, WP3, WP4 and WP5
Task 621 Creation of a stakeholders database in collaboration with country teams
Task 622 In collaboration with the Stakeholders Group and WP leaders, development of a survey questionnaire to be distributed among the list of stakeholders included in the database Task 623 Analysis of stakeholders input data
Task 624 Organisation of online meetings with Stakeholders Group to inform about progress and gather feedback
Task 625 Organisation of workshop with stakeholders from different countries
The third objective is to ensure the effective dissemination and communication of the progress and results of EqualStrength to a variety of audiences The WP6 leader will coordinate with the Project leader, WP leaders, Advisory Board and Stakeholders Group to produce and release the following dissemination products: country reports (Task 631), policy briefings about discrimination in the housing market (Task 632), labour market (Task 633), and childcare (Task 634); reports on the role of institutional factors on discrimination (as measured in field experiments) (Task 635) and on minorities’ policy preferences(Task 636) Communication of The project's main findings will be communicated to the media via press releases and press notes (Task 638)

   Work package(s) involved
   Proposed risk mitigation measures
  Loss of staff 
Low risk
   All WPs
  Measures to minimise risk: involvement of more than one researcher per institution team; most partners have experience in EU funded projects and knowingly agreed to participate This commitment will be reconfirmed before signing the Grant Agreement Regular online meetings will guarantee team building among junior staff members and a steady commitment to the project
 Measures to mitigate consequences: the consortium will replace staff with partner(s) with a similar profile and expertise
  PART B   37

             
  Failure to deliver high quality research within the planned time frame  Low risk
    WP2, WP3, WP4, WP5
    Measures to minimise risk: close monitoring of progress by WP leaders and the Research Committee
 Measures to mitigate consequences: should a partner fail to fulfil its tasks, the Coordination and Management team (in collaboration with the Research Committee) will reassign the task to another consortium partner
  Insufficient attention from targeted stakeholders  Medium risk
   WP6
  Measures to minimise risk: policymakers and NGOs personnel are typically very busy We will avoid overloading them with multiple tasks and to collect their input only for the tasks they are specifically interested in We have involved a few people with whom we have collaborated in the past, which guarantees mutual trust and commitment
 Measures to mitigate consequences: We plan to engage with a sufficient number of stakeholders, so we are not particularly reliant on one of them
   Failure to reach target sample sizes for the data collection tasks within the planned time frame  Low risk
   WP2, WP4, WP5
  Measures to minimise risk: participants have extensive experience in all the data collection methods Reaching the target sample is mainly a risk in WP2: we will focus on occupations with a high volume of vacancies and neighbourhoods and cities with a high availability of childcare services and housing agencies This implies a larger focus on urban areas but, given the higher barriers faced by ethnic minorities in rural areas and less diverse contexts, it most likely provides a conservative measure of cumulative discrimination Another possible risk is detection (ie the risk that employers, real estate agents or preschool administrators realise they are part of a field experiment) We will employ an unpaired design (one application per participant), which is known to mitigate the risk of detection In WP5, where the aim is to collect data among harder to reach minority groups, we have opted for non probability sampling via social networking, which guarantees more effective coverage
 Measures to mitigate consequences: In case of detection in WP2, we will involve participants in the study and ask them to share their views on discrimination, thus avoiding open confrontation or the generation of negative emotions

32 Capacity of participants and consortium as a whole
The EqualStrength consortium includes experts from 10 institutions based in 9 European countries The participants were selected for their research expertise, implementation capacity, geographical location, and gender balance (9 female and 7 male researchers) In this section we highlight five distinctive features of the EqualStrength consortium that represent its uniqueness:
Interdisciplinarity: one of the most outstanding characteristics of the EqualStrength consortium is its interdisciplinarity The researchers involved in the proposal come from a wide breadth of fields, including sociology, economics, social psychology, and demography This interdisciplinarity reflects the fact that discrimination, racism and ethnic inequalities are topics that cut across academic disciplines, thus requiring

innovative ideas and concepts that build on the strengths of each of them EqualStrength represents a robust research programme that will bridge debates across fields and will push scientific knowledge on structural racism and discrimination to the next level
Methodological expertise: the consortium's methodological expertise is outstanding All scholars involved have extensive experience in survey design and implementation; experimental research methods applied to surveys, laboratories, and in the field; and sampling vulnerable and hard to reach populations EqualStrength thus represents a unique opportunity to expand the scholarly knowledge on structural racism and discrimination from a rigorous empirical perspective
Academic rigour: EqualStrength brings together leading and emerging scholars on the topics of the call Their recent investigations have been published in highly ranked academic journals in their fields, which guarantees the high impact of the project’s scientific outputs Based on Google Scholar, the number of citations received by the members of the consortium combined amounts to 2,264 just in 2021
Societal impact: academic insights without a policy perspective would mean that the research remains within academia and has little impact in the real world EqualStrength will not face this risk: the academics in the consortium have experience in disseminating their research to broader audiences and are part of knowledge exchange networks with policymakers, think tanks and international organisations, including the Race Disparity Unit (UK), the Office for National Statistics (UK), IOM, OECD, UN, or the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights, to name a few They also have media experience, and their research has been cited in high  impact media outlets such as The Economist, The Washington Post, The Guardian, Financial Times, BBC News, WiredUK, Nature Podcast, El País or El Diarioes The leader of WP6 (Impact and dissemination) is based at University of OxfordMigration Observatory (ERSC prize for Outstanding Impact in Society) and she will make use of her broad experience on impact and dissemination activities to maximise EqualStrength’s societal impact
Experience in management of research funds: the members of the consortium, including the Project leader (Mathew Creighton), have substantial managerial expertise Mathew Creighton is currently the
Among the researchers involved in EqualStrength, there are two ERC grantees; three PIs of the EU funded projects GEMM, INGRID, WEBDATANET, and TEMPER; WP and country leaders in other EU funded projects, such as FamiliesAndSocieties, MAFE, or CEASEVAL; and Co Is or PIs of research projects funded by national research
agencies in their respective countries
In sum, EqualStrength is supported by a strong consortium in which all participants bring the necessary
expertise to achieve the project’s objectives and expected impacts
